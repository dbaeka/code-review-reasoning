Is it possible to create a table with no snapshot? If so, should we throw an exception here?
`FailedToReachCollector` event has been renamed to `FailedToReachCollectorWithUri`.
I'm not sure what this is doing, but it's not matching the code in the example.
I think this should be "Instead of using exit() or quit(), consider using sys.exit()."
put failed, ret 1000
This is a bit confusing, because I think the glue code is the code that is in `node/bee` (which is not included in this PR).
I think it would be more readable if you would just inline the variable and write the condition as `if (isGoQuorumCompatibilityMode && privacyParameters.isPresent())`
I'm not sure about this one. The primitive type should be the first type in the list of types, but it's not necessarily the first child of the result type. For example, the result type of a method that returns an array could be `List<String>[]`. In that case, the
`R1716` -> `R1716`
If we're using the body_class filter, we should also be using the body_class_stack filter. Otherwise we're not going to be able to add multiple classes to the body class.
I don't think we should be exposing this. It should be an internal flag that we only use in the client.
The disabled-button is a disabled button.
Nit: I think this should be called `method` (not `methodName`)
This is wrong. /opt/puppet/bin is the default.
io.servicecomb.java-chassis java-chassis
Can we rename this to `zapLogger` or `defaultLogger` to make it more clear that this is the default logger?
Align the elements of a hash literal if they span more than one line.
nit: I think we can just use `self._tabbed_browser.moveTab(cur_idx, new_idx)` here.
Returns a IDictionary{TKey, TValue} from parsing data. A string containing key-value pairs which are comma-separated, and for which the key and value are colon-separated.
This method is unused.
Nit: I'd rename this to something like `TEST_STORE_NAME_SLUG` to make it more clear what it is.
Is this needed?
should we check if the ifaceName is not "cali" or "cali.local" ?
This class is now completely empty.
I'm not sure this is very helpful. Can we make it say what the current window size is?
HttpAccess.init should be called once per process
Standards: Please remove the extra empty line.
This should be `self._tab.key_press(Qt.Key_Return)`
this function should be deleted.
Is there a reason to pass `hash.ZeroHash256` to `NewStateDBAdapter` here?
@marek-zurek I think this should be: if ($offset - $end_pos === 2 && substr($file_contents, $end_pos, 2) === '::') { return [$possible_reference, '::', $offset]; }
I'd say the first one should be enough, but I'm not sure about the second one.
@whai362 I'm not sure if this is the correct version of the model. Can you double check?
Nit: Can we call this `AgreementFilterTimeoutPeriod` or `AgreementFilterTimeoutPeriod0` to make it clear that it's the period?
Line is too long. [103/80]
Assertion failed: expect(Suspender1.prototype.render).to.have.been.calledTwice.
Shouldn't we use the new `testContainer` here?
I'm not sure why this was marked as `Non-blocking` before.
I don't think we need to use the `HttpInListener` activity. We can just use the `HttpRequestIn` activity.
Should we log the error if we fail to set the replicas to 0?
Is this correct? Shouldn't it be `gs://bucket/(.+)`?
Style/GuardClause: Use a guard clause instead of wrapping the code inside a conditional expression.
Is this change needed?
Use 2 (not 1) spaces for indentation.
Metrics/LineLength: Line is too long. [121/120]
NABoolean -> bool
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
I think we should not log this here. We already have the log for this in the above code.
"Error reloading permissions file. Please use perm_getAccountsWhitelist and perm_getNodesAllowlist to review the current state of the whitelists")
If we want to have this, we need to update the tests to pass.
@tvalentyn - this change will break a lot of tests, because it will always return true. The previous code checks for the presence of both states and role. I think it would be better to keep the previous code.
error: 'MolTransforms' was not declared in this scope
The name of the header is ProxyHashTables.hpp.
This should be `if (sep < 0)`
shouldCorrectlyForceReindexOnCollection is skipped.
Nit: It would be more idiomatic to use `f.Set(reflect.ValueOf(newSlice))`
I think this should be `cbor:",toarray"` to avoid the issue with the struct size.

Can we make this an error if the job doesn't exist?
The ImportError is not caught.
`[\p{L}\p{N}\s\-_',:\[\]!\./\\\(\)&]*` is not a valid regular expression.
@jridgewell Can you confirm that this is the right fix?
This is not needed, it's the default value

This import order is wrong, it should be `from mitmproxy.proxy import context`
Please add a blank line between imports and the first non-import line.
@JeremyKuhne is this what you had in mind?
This is a test plan.
This function should be moved to NetworkUtils.h

nit: you can merge these two lines into one
This is not an error, right?
$("#txtLoginAttemptsBeforeLockout", page).val(user.Policy.LoginAttemptsBeforeLockout || "0"), loading.hide()
I'm not sure I like this change. It's equivalent to a command line option that I think we want to avoid.
This is the function that actually does the work.
This should probably be called something like `dataframe_input_from_csv` to be more descriptive.
I think the CLI flag should be called "TLSDisableHostVerification" to be consistent with the env var.
The constructor is not needed. You can remove it.
> no error will be returned due to renewal lock (i.e. because a renewal is already happening). This lack of error is by intention to force cache invalidation as though it has renewed. This is not a very clear description of what's going on here.

this is the only thing that changes in this PR. The rest is just cleanup.
I'm a little confused why we need this channel. The `reportCommand` function is called in the `Run` function. The `Run` function is called in the `Main` function. The `Main` function is called from the `Start` function. The `Start` function is called from the

NLog.NLogRuntimeException : The LogManager is already flushing.
I think we should keep this code, since the `PythonSdkType.isStdLib(vf, sdk)` check will be redundant in the `PythonSdkType.isStdLib(vf, sdk)` call in `PythonSdkType.getSdkType()`
@KonajuDoan I don't think this will work. This is only for the new web platform API.
Nit: It's a bit weird to have this as a struct, since it's only used in a single place. Maybe just make it a `type` and use it directly?
@michaelkuhn I'm wondering if we should change this to use Stream.of(iterable)...
This seems like it should be a different error.
I'm not sure if this is correct. I think it should be -1 on line 2138 and 2139.
Missing argument - invitation_id for method invitation.
`last_modified` is not used here.
why do we need to set this?

Is this change required?
Standards: Please add a space after commas.
@tgamblin This line was changed to `pandas==0.20.0` so that the tests pass with `pip install -U pip`
Is this going to be a lot of output? If so, we should probably have a separate log file for it.
AssertionError: HTTP 404 Not Found
I think this is the wrong change.

@chicm Do we need to change the kModelVersion for the other version of LightGBM?
I would not use `https` in the regexp, since we are using it only for GitHub.

I think we can add this to the `DataFrame` docs, as well.
Do we want to limit the history to something like 100?

@mattpap @chrahunt @njhill @erikrose I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand, this seems like a good way to get the information from the browser, but on the other hand, I'm not sure if this is the right way to
nit: this is a bit verbose, perhaps a simple `gauge` would be more concise.
This is not correct, as the timespec struct has a 32-bit field.
@tgamblin I'm wondering if you can give me a hand with this one. I'm not sure if it's possible to disable the useless suppression in the case of E1101.
This should be `RootfsMountMode PropagationMode `json:"root_mount_mode"`
The type annotation for this line is wrong. It should be: __path__ = __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)  # type: Optional[List[str]]
I think this should be called "DisableHttpGitRepository" to be consistent with the other settings.
Can you explain what this does?
This should be a static import
I think this is a no-op since it is already configured in the servlet filter
This is the only place where ReadOnlyDbProvider is used.
This is an unrelated change.

Is this going to cause issues?
list<array> is a type alias for array[]
I don't think we should be importing the component here. It should be done in the same way as the other components.
I think we should just say "Invalid username or email."
Metrics/LineLength: Line is too long. [121/120]
This seems like it could be a very general interface. Maybe it should be called `Monitoring` or something.
I think we should check for the existence of the owner before calling `topology.startSession` and if it's not defined we should throw an error. Otherwise we can end up in a situation where the user passes an invalid owner, which will result in an error at a later point.
The "id" attribute is required for the account_out tag.
I don't think we should fix up the host here. We should only fix up the host if the user specifies a host, and if the host is invalid. If the user specifies a host, but we are not setting the host, then the host will be invalid, so we should fix it up
The ADIOS_HAVE_ADIOS1 check is no longer necessary since the ADIOS1Reader.h is included.
@mheon is this ok?

@Jon-Caswell I'm not sure if we should update this to "AWS IAM" or "AWS Identity and Access Management"
I think this will not work, because the height is not defined, so you will get an error here.
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
@rhtyd I am not sure what this is doing. I am not seeing any code that sets isClosed to TRUE. Can you help me understand?
This test is not very meaningful, since it's not clear what the expected outcome is.
{"status": 200, "body": "OK"}
This is not necessary, the event handler will be called only if the pool add event is handled.
`plugin_missing` should be `plugin_missing_name`
This should be a `String` type.
Minor: this brace should be on a newline
Is this going to be a problem? I'm guessing that this is a debug statement and not a warning that should be output.
nit: consider using a stream here
I'm not sure if this is correct. I think it should be the other way around.
I'm not sure if this is the correct change, but I think we should make it case insensitive.
This is a bit confusing. I'm not sure if it's better to add the validations on the `init` method or on the `create` method.
This should be `transfer_tab`.
This is a breaking change.

I don't think you want this here, but I'm not sure where you'd put it.
I'm not sure why this was removed. The only place this is used is in `create_package` and it is used to create the `pkgobj` instance. I'm not sure why it was removed.
@smarterclayton This was a bug in the code. I'm not sure why it was a Warn instead of an Error.
This will remove the option from the new config if it exists in the old config.
I think you need to change the return type here to `[]*Diff`
I think we should have a `Response` field here, and `Body` should be a pointer to `VersionsResponse`.
Is this the correct way to do this? I'm not sure I've ever seen a function that takes a const char * that doesn't actually take a const char * in the function.

Method do_take_snapshot is deprecated and will be removed in 0.10.0. Use snapshot_name.to_sym instead.

I'm not sure I understand why we need to copy the Account here. It seems like we're just doing a shallow copy of the mappings.
This is not a valid namespace.
I think it's better to use uint64 for both, epochNum and nextEpoch.
Can you explain why we need this?
This should be lowercase, and the case should be consistent with other keys in this file.

This should be computedNumOfActivePartitions_
I think you should have a method called "getFlowFile" which takes the flow name as a parameter. That way you can keep the method names consistent.
This method should be renamed to iterator(Schema)
going to upload! /Users/bryce/Library/RubyMine/projects/test-upload/uploads/test-upload.txt to bryce-macbook-pro.local:~/Desktop/test-upload.txt
I think this is not a good idea, as it's a bit confusing to have an attack message when you're trying to attack yourself. Maybe it would be better to check for this in the auto_attack function?
snprintf(str,128,"unknown *KEYWORD: %s", arg[ioffset]); [snprintf] does not have a return value, so the compiler will not warn if you use a too small buffer. You should use the return value from snprintf.
This line is a bit hard to read. It's better to use a variable name for the config value.
0.0001 is a very small value, we should probably use a larger value.
This import is not used
This doesn't seem like a good solution to me. I think it's better to just not instrument the code.
This is a string, not a number.
I think this is the right change, but it is also a change in API. Is it safe to do?
This should be `cmds.ServerConfig`.

curl: (23) Failed to connect to mirror.ctan.org port 80: No route to host
I'm not sure this is the right place to put this. The category map is just a list of category shortcuts, it doesn't contain the icons.
Should this be `SecretPrefix` instead of `SecretName`?
Nit: this looks like a bug, you're using the wrong type here.
I think this is wrong, and the `unix` prefix is required. I'm not sure why it's not required here.
We expect that case if
`use strict` is not needed in the test file.
`loadbalanced` should be lowercase.
time.Duration is used instead of ds.Duration.
Please add a docstring here.
View your request for feedback
This is going to be a bit confusing, but I think the best we can do is to add a `?` to the type and call it `NamedList<?>`.
I'm not sure if this is right, but the error message doesn't make sense.
I don't think this is the right default. This should be false.
I think we should be careful with this. It's possible to have the `default_bucket` in the `excludes` list, which would cause a conflict with the `includes` list. I'm not sure if this is a good idea.
I'm not sure if we want to remove this test, it's still testing that the redeemer does not accept any params.
@smarterclayton This is the only change I could think of to get rid of the NPE.
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
Can you use `import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;` instead?
`size_prefixed` is not used in this function.

[11, 0, 11, 0]
Shouldn't we keep the default backends?
I'm not sure about this change. It's not clear to me what the expected behavior is. I think we need to test it.

Is there a reason to remove this log?
Use %w or %W for an array of words.
If the user has a newer version of Python, they will be able to use the built-in ``main`` module. This change ensures that we don't try to pop the ``__main__`` module from the module cache if the user has a newer version of Python.

"metric variable must not be null"
The naming here is a bit confusing. I'm not sure if we should be calling it a "grace period" or a "leeway". I'm also not sure if we should be using a TimeSpan or a double here.
I don't think this is a good idea. If you want to use the `create_no_window` functionality, you should pass `create_no_window=True` to the constructor.
Layout/MultilineMethodCallIndentation: Align .tap with .merge on line 21.
I'm not sure this is the right way to do this. If I want to add a dependency to the framework section, I'd expect to specify a framework.
@tannergooding - this is the one place we have the #ifdef. I'm not sure if it's necessary. I was thinking we could just have a nullable dictionary and have the property be nullable, and then we wouldn't need to have the #ifdef.

I'm not sure if we want to use the `archer` package here, but I'm ok with it.

I think the `T` should be removed from the `findElements` signature, because `By` can be used with any `WebElement` type, and the `T` can be inferred from the type of the `WebElement` that is passed in.

nit: this should be in a `defer`
Why is this test removed?
I think we should use `FileNotFoundError` instead of `OSError` here.
nit: we should add the error handling here
The docstring for this error is too long.
Can we add the source to the `EXECUTION_SOURCE_` constants?
@mitchellhenke can you please help me understand why we need to pass the action? I'm not seeing it used anywhere.
Please add a TODO to remove this field when we are using a single pool.
fontWeight E.g., '600'
This seems like it should be a constant.

Why do we need to store the number of API calls in the store?
(style) line over 80 characters
I think this is a typo, it should be `casSnapshot`
Incorrect import order.
@philsturgeon @mikeshultz I'm not sure if this is correct, I'm guessing it is.
This is a little weird. Why are we populating the span here? The `Span` is a private member, so we should be able to access it from within the `catch` block.
Pod Failure
posix='win' not in sys.platform -> posix='win' in sys.platform
I'd make this an unsigned int, and make sure it is initialized to 0.
@dengemann, @Eric89GXL, @jglick, do you know why this function is needed? I can't see any use for it.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea. If you remove the subrepo, you'll have to re-run `plz init` and then re-run `plz build`.
assert_is_extension(cmd, node)
Line is too long. [101/80]
I think this is not the right fix, because it's not only the literal type that is changed.
@marek-andrys This is the change I mentioned. I'm not sure if this is a breaking change or not.
This is a very minor change, but I'd like to point out that the order of these values is not necessarily consistent across all commands. The `git` command, for example, does not include the `false_positive` value.
Add import order for the new imports.
This is the only place in the script where the user is prompted for input. I don't think it should be in the main loop, and it's not clear what to do with the response.
I think it's more clear if we call it "Scorable leaf collector"
This test fails on Python 3.6 and 3.7.
I don't understand why you're using getattr here. It seems like you should just be able to call self.underlayer.seq.
Please use `static constexpr char` instead of `static const char`.
pool_param = this->layer_param_.pooling_param();
pod status operation: updatePodStatus unsupported
This should be `return err`
I think this should be called `snippetVersion` and be used to generate the `version` attribute in the HTML snippet.
Nit: I think it would be better to move this to the top of the form since it's the first thing the user sees.
This method is unused.
isCaret is not a parameter of setReviewPosition.
Is this flag intended to be a toggle? If so, we should call it `recursive` instead of `recurse`.
<script type="text/javascript"> window.analytics||(window.analytics=[]),window.analytics.methods=["identify","track","trackLink","trackForm","trackClick","trackSubmit","page","pageview","ab","alias","ready","group","on","once","off
I think it would be better to rename `key` to `name` here, because the value is the name of the type, not the name of the config type.
I'm not sure why this is here?
Is this still needed?
@jona-sassenrath: I think this function is a bit more complex than what you intended. It can also be used for subclasses of a class that is not a class. In that case, it will return False. I think this function should only be used for classes.
Is this the same as the dark theme?
Should we have a better name for this variable?
This looks like a bug. It should be: `thread_pool& io_thread_pool = get_io_thread_pool();`
Can you explain why we need this?
Could you elaborate on this?
I don't think this is needed, as we already dispose the source in the previous Dispose method.
@pjainfote: This class should be renamed to `ArrayInitializationVerbosenessRuleTest`
nit: remove this extra line
Align the parameters of a method call if they span more than one line.

Should this be #ifdef __ANDROID__ ?
I think this should be `lastRefreshTime time.Time` as well, right?
@nmittler I'm not sure about this one. The logging level for INFO is 1000, and the level for FINEST is 100. So this will log the same thing as INFO, but will also log all the calls to this method. Is that what you want
This is not needed, this can be an enum in the SDK
I don't think we need this. The default tool is already the one that's being used.
This should be a single line.

The ANDROID_NDK_HOME environment variable should be the default.
Do not use the new Ruby 1.9 hash syntax for parameter lists.
`moveToFolder` should be renamed to `moveToNotebook` or `moveToNotebooks`
I'm not sure if this is a good change. If we don't have a deadline, we should return an error, because we don't know how long the call will take.
I'm not sure why this is changed, but I'm fine with it.
I don't think this is the right fix, the original code is doing something different. It's adding the current thread name and the stage name. This is just adding the current thread name.
This is the only place where we return `Task.CompletedTask`
NIT: why did you change the order of these lines?
I'm not sure this is right. If I understand correctly, the `sensitive` option is used to determine if the prompt should be sensitive, not to determine what type of data is returned. The latter is handled by the `type` option.
The error is probably due to the fact that the program is not MPI enabled. This can be checked by looking at the error message.
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.

This looks like it should be `^VuFind ([\d\.]+)$` (the `+` is to match multiple digits, not a plus sign)

This is a very bad idea. This will not work in any case. If the attribute is not present, the lazy attribute will be added. If the attribute is present, but empty, the lazy attribute will be added.

I think this should be `self.instance.all_logs(self.run_id, of_type=DagsterEventType.STEP_SKIPPED, step_key=step_output_handle.step_key)`
Shouldn't this be public?
Please add a blank line between the namespace and the class.
This exception is never thrown. I think the code would be better if the decryption was skipped and the exception was thrown.
I think it is not necessary to add the calc genesis block here, as the calc genesis block is already added to the store above.

"could not get hermes id: error getting hermes id"
Nit: We should probably make this configurable, so that we can disable it for certain services.
import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableSet from com.google.common.collect.ImmutableSet
I think this import is unused.
@KalebLauziere I don't think this should be here. It's a setting for the speech viewer, not the main app.

@brycemartin144 @gustavonalle @satishg89 This is the code that I added. I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it. The idea is to only show the alarm notification if the data is stale.
@chrsmith I'm not sure if we want to allow this to be specified for generic deployments, or if it should be limited to only deployments with the `kubernetes` or `openshift` provider. I think the latter is probably the right thing to do.
Unused import org.openqa.selenium.net.Urls;
This is a good catch. I wonder if it's worth to also test for the pod not being deleted when the node is not gone.
This is a bit confusing. Why do we destroy the context if the property is not set?

this is not the lease's address, it's the tx's address.
I think it's probably better to have the original `vnode` as the second argument to `assign`, so that it's passed to `cloneNode` and `patch`.
`DialogFragment.STYLE_NORMAL` has no effect on `DialogFragment.STYLE_NO_TITLE` so this will not change the color of the title bar.

This is a bit unrelated to the rest of the PR, but is this really necessary?
I'm not sure this is a regression?
@steveharter - I'm curious what you think of this. The idea here is to make it easier to use a custom TextMapPropagator. However, the default is still a composite TextMapPropagator. Is that what you would expect?
I think this import is unused.
@logger.notice("Starting command run '#{command}' on #{targets.map(&:uri)}")
I'm not sure if this is better than just passing the builder to the `Sdk.CreateMeterProvider` call. I think the latter is a bit more readable, but the former is a bit more efficient.
I think you mean "minimize" here.
Invalid flipping direction 'right'
I'm not sure this is correct. I think it should be: newVNode._children = isTopLevelFragment ? tmp.props.children : tmp;
Is this the same as the `c.KubernetesProvider == config.ProviderAKS && c.RouteSource == "WorkloadIPs"` condition?
If the value is not an array, this will return false. So you will have to add a check for this.
I'm not sure this is the right place for this method. I'm not sure what this is supposed to do. I'm also not sure what the `@access public` is for.
Reverse the order of planes in layer sequence. False for ResNet, True for Houglass. Default: False

[PASSED] nextFetchDate works correctly to grab times before the timeout.
This is a bit of a nit, but it's more idiomatic to use `continue` rather than `return false` in a loop.
Line is too long. [107/80]
Cannot create a plan with a lookback that is not positive, lookback = 0
I'm not sure this is the best way to do this. If you catch both errors, you'll never know which one is actually the problem. It's probably better to have a `userscripts.UnsupportedError` subclass that catches both errors, and then just catch that.
Warnf() and Eventf() should be on the same line.
The name of this class is a bit misleading, since it's not a binary string.
We need to add a check to make sure the response header is not already set by the client.
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundClassBody: Extra empty line detected at class body end.
I think this is the right thing to do, but the way it's written makes it look like the mask is being stored as an atomic pointer, which it isn't.
This was just a test to ensure the output was the same.
The class name should be the same as the class name in the phpdoc block above.

This was an accidental change.
nit: remove this line
Is there a way to do this in one call?
The `cmap` argument is now a required argument, but it defaults to `dflt_cmap`.
This should be "filtered out"
Tuple with information about the location of a to-be-displayed message.
I'm not sure about this. I think we should be able to do this without importing importlib, which is a bit weird.
I think we need to have a policy for updating the directory in the case where `path` is `None`.
This should be called in the `onDestroy` lifecycle method, which is called after `onStart` and before `onStop`.
this was a test config file
This is a bit scary. I'm not sure what happens if the context is nil.

nit: this should be agentlessID, not agentID.
nit: maybe use `strings.HasSuffix(base, ".build_defs")` instead of the regex?
Is this a good idea? If I change the SecurityGroupOverrides and TagSecurityGroups fields in the API object, I'm changing the behavior of the update operation. Is that what we want?
We don't need this, the test should be using the global variable.
Is this a typo?
I think we should also add a timeout for when the page loads. This will be the same as the pageLoadTimeout.
I don't think this is correct, we should be checking if the component type is a function, not the property type.
I don't think this is right. If there is a max subscriptions specified, then we should be adding to the client.
I'm not sure about the name of this method. Maybe `fill` isn't the best name, but I don't know what would be better.
I don't think this is correct, the locator list is a vector of pointers, so you should be able to just use `locator_list.begin()` and `locator_list.end()`
Is there a reason to use isinstance here?
This should be a link to the correct page, and the error code should be `INVALID_PARAM`
This is not correct. This method should never return null.
Please add a blank line after the `import` statement.
`RuntimeDescription` is unused. Consider removing it.
Please add a description for the new enum value
I think the `AppDomainFixedOutput` attribute is still valid here.
I'm not sure what this flag does.
I think we should use a setting of type `ImageResizeCircumference` here. This would allow us to use a default value of `0` and also to add a `min` and `max` property.
The name of the interface is misleading. It doesn't parse start line, it parses a request.
nit: can we make this `../collection` and `../db` more explicit?
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
this is not really a URL. The `githubURLFlag` is a URL. The `repoURLFlag` is a path.
@mikedoan can you add a check to ensure that the cache is empty before running this?
The name reload_scripts is a bit misleading. It is more of a re-evaluate_scripts, which would be more descriptive.
This should be moved to the top of the import list.
wrong order?
I think it would be more consistent to add a default value for `filename` and not use None.
This is a bug fix.
scol is not defined.
nit: maybe we should use `toLowerCamelCase` here?
This is a breaking change, so I would like to see if it's worth it.
This line is a bit confusing to me, as it's not a version of the plan, but a version of the artifact.
I don't think this is needed.
I'm not sure this is right. I'm guessing it's a bug in the original code, but it's possible that I'm wrong. I'm also not sure why the second seek is needed, as the code seems to be able to compute the hash without it.
Can you please explain the TODO?
I'm not sure if it's the best solution, but it works for now.
I would not remove this interface.

Are these all necessary? It looks like we're only using `DeleteObjectsCommand` and `PutObjectCommand`
nit: extra empty line
@robertwb I'm not sure what you mean by this, I'm assuming you mean the same thing as I do, but just want to be sure. The CAN driver is async, and the async_select_unrequired flag is set to True.
This was a bug.
I don't think this is needed.

This is the one I don't understand. I don't see why it's removed.
This should be done in `getRow` if `newEntity` is not null.

/' . preg_quote($remove_var_id, '/') . '[\]\[\-]/
This package is unused.
This parameter determines the time range the listen search. Each increment of the time_range corresponds to a range of 5 days and the default time_range of 3 means that 15 days will be searched.
This flag should be named `max_results_admin_api_list` or something like that.
The GuidPrefix_t is not used anymore.
This is the same as the one in `Ia2Web`. Can we remove the copy?
If we set this here, we will be able to use the proxies for the whole request. But the `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request` class will only have the proxies for the first request. So we need to set it here.
Nit: "BServer: Get %s done (err=%v)", id, err"
`group` should be moved up to be with `dialog` and `document`
I don't think this is necessary, as the only place that uses `OrderedDict` is in `get_result_dict`, which is only used in tests.
This looks like it should be `registerServiceForOS`.
This description is a bit misleading. This sampler is always off by default, but can be turned on by calling Enable() on the sampler.
`endsWith` is not guaranteed to be thread safe. Please use `String#endsWith(String, String#Case#CASE_INSENSITIVE_NORMAL)` instead.
"Test get_global_operations"
This is going to look really weird.
@rhatdan I think we can do the same here.
Standards: Please add braces to this conditional statement.
Time.zone.local(2016, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0) is not found in the database.
Please remove the extra new line.
Nit: you can use `var` instead of `var` here
We don't have to do case-insensitive match here.
{ (style) code indent should use tabs where possible
The import is not needed, the class is in the same package.
Please add the same here
It seems to me that this is not correct. `z-index` is an integer and not a boolean. I would expect this to be `0` when the element is hidden.
Why not just check for `iss.Spec.Vault.Auth.SecretRef != nil`
Missing `end` at 21, 4.
This will never be called.
I think this is fine, but if you're going to be changing this code, you might want to use the new `wlr_backend_get_display()` function instead.
logical-tautology - this is a logical tautology, and should be removed from the logic.
The casts are unnecessary since the targetType is already an instance of the type being cast to.
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
I don't see this being used anymore?
iproto is not defined
I think it's better to have a constant like `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` or something like that.
I'm not sure this is the best way to do this. I'm not sure we want to wait for the private fetch before we do the blog title validation. I think it's more important to get the blog title than the config. I'm thinking we should just validate the blog title first and
I think it should be final.

@michaelmuessig I'm not sure if this is correct. I think it should be `\\'` not `'`
IMAP, SMTP, WebDAV, POP3 -> IMAP, SMTP, POP3, WebDAV
this is a mock for the feedback service.
This will break the boto.version.compare() function. We should probably fix that.
Can you please add a TODO to remove this?
"URL of my.mysterium.network API"
The flag could not be read
@david-johnson @Eric-Arellano I'm not sure why this was there in the first place. It looks like it was meant to be `except KeyError:`.
@samsondavis @mmaxwell @brycemcconnell @dmitsh @tgamblin I'm not sure what's the best way to phrase this. I'm not sure if the "lookup" part of the error message is necessary.
I'm not sure if this is correct. The interface doesn't have a type parameter, so it should be `DigraphNode<E>`.
@garystevenson This should be `--identity-string`
@mheon @joshrobbins @pgavlin I think we should probably change the name of this prompt to something like "infrastructure pattern" or "application architecture" or something similar to what the other prompts are called.
Standards: Please add a blank line after `@throws \Exception`.
This is wrong. text/plain is not the default type for html, xml, or xhtml.
I think we can just use `nameMapping` instead of `updateNameMapping`
I don't think this should be logged at all.
This was causing the build error.
I'm not sure if this is intentional or not, but the code below seems to use TableIDType as well.
nit: please move this to the next line
Loglevel overrides loglevel-driver and loglevel-on-instance and sets the same level for both on-instance and driver logging: [crit|error|warn|info|debug]
@stevegsa @tgamblin @brycef @matt-stephens this is a change to the way we run the `filter.rb` script on Travis. I wanted to avoid the "Travis has filtered out this build" message, and also make sure that the
Why was this removed?
Please add a space before the `DiskLimiter`
Nit: Can we add a space after the `return` to make it more readable?
The import android.annotation.SuppressLint should be removed
Was this a merge error?
This is a very good point. But it's not the only way to fix this. It's also possible to add a check to the listener class to see if it's attached or not.
/^channel [beta|dev|nightly|release]$/i
I think it's more readable to do the first part of the conditional on its own line.
This is not very helpful. Maybe "using resource updates where applicable" or "using resource updates"
Why the increment?
The error is returned from `updateOrderStatus`, which is not a method of `Order`.
Add empty line after `import` statement.
nit: I think we can remove the `selectColumns` parameter since it is only used in the `select` method and it is not a public method.
If a task is rejected by the host Executor, the failed task will then be executed on the caller thread. This is done to ensure that a query succeeds, albeit with a higher latency. If a user wishes to modify the said behaviour, they can either handle the exception in the provided Executor,
Unhandled rejection Error: [Error: Network Error] Stack: Error: Network Error
This is a bit of a nit, but I think it would be clearer if we renamed this enum to `enumspb.WORKFLOW_BACKOFF_TYPE_CRON` and then had a `enumspb.WORKFLOW_BACKOFF_TYPE_UNKNOWN
This file should be removed.
This is now using the `content-drilldown` report.
Is this going to cause a problem with the compiler?
Nit: `has_value` is a bit misleading, as it can be true for a nullptr. I think it would be better to just use `r.filter_ref().value_or(nullptr)` here.
@jridgewell this should be `options.source`
Workshops, Videos, Books
Variable should be renamed to VariableType
Did not receive correct response: 404 Not Found
I don't see any changes in this file.
I think this can be removed.
`navigatingURL` is used here, but not used in the `useEffect` below. Is that a bug?
I'm not sure this error message is clear enough. I'd suggest something like "multiple addresses in the upstream dial string (upstream must map to only one address)".
If `o` is null, then `o = ((JSONObject) o).opt(pathElement);` will throw a `NullPointerException` in the case of a JSONObject.
Is this supposed to be `Type: ECSIPAMPluginName` or `Type: "ECSIPAMPluginName"`?
time.Now() should be used instead of Unix()

I don't think this change is necessary. I don't think we need to exclude methods that are not streaming. I think it's fine to include all methods, and then exclude those that are not page streaming.
`QUERY_ID` should be `query_id` (camel case)
I think we can remove the `h` from this function signature, and just pass in the harness to the new function.
I'm not sure if this is the correct fix. Is it possible to test this with the newest SDK?
This is removed because the test was broken.

Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
The `Eventually` function waits for a condition to be true for a given number of seconds. If the condition is true before the timeout, the function returns immediately. If the condition is not true before the timeout, the function returns with an error.
Can we use `types.Ask` here instead of `Ask`?
I think this is a bug in the sample.

The code below will never be executed if `replaceNode === null`.
The code in this file is very hard to read. It would be nice to have a static method that returns the country code given the country name.
I think this change is unrelated to the other changes.
@pwd: I think this is wrong, as the `methodDeclarator` is not an access.
I think it would be better to call this `memoryCircuitBreakerSize` or `memoryCircuitBreakerThreshold` or something like that, to make it more clear that this is a size (in MB) rather than a number of requests.
@spooktheduck I don't understand why this is needed.
This doesn't make sense to me. Why would the concrete API take care of retry logic? What about the concrete API is not able to retry?
I'm not sure why this is necessary, but I'm going to make a note to add it to the docs.
@dvoytenko I think this is the right fix, but I'm not sure how to test it.
I don't think this import is necessary, since you're not using the class anywhere.
This is not the only change in this file, right?
This function was previously named `ReadCloser`. I changed it to `FileReader` to be more descriptive.
I think you can simplify this to `a.hasFoundationBonusExtension() && a.grantFoundationBonus(epochNum)`

"Disabled" is a little confusing here. I think "NotifyDuringQuietTime" would be more clear.

Use 2 (not 1) spaces for indentation.
I think we can remove the `selfNS` argument and the `matchSelf` flag.
This is a test program to test the Kokkos::Tools library.
PartialResponseStrategy is only used by ThanosRuler and will be ignored by Prometheus instances. Valid values for this field are 'warn' or 'abort'. More info: https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/master/docs/components/rule.md

@smarterclayton I don't know if this is a good idea or not.
I think you can delete this newline
"Increase block processor transaction batch write size, default 0 (limited by config block_processor_batch_max_time)"
I think it's better to check if the feature is enabled in the configuration.
Nit: This is not a delete, but a soft-delete.
I'm not sure this should be exported, since it's only used in tests.
This change seems unrelated.
I think you'll need to change this to `NVDAObjects.UIA` (and `NVDAObjects.window` below) to make it work.
@cramforce @erwinmombay @erwinmombay I'm not sure how to handle this change. I'm not sure how to make this test pass.

If ta is nil, I'd expect this to return an error.
nit: I would call this `Foobar`
I don't think we should add this check here, since it will cause an extra call to `hot.countSourceCols` which is not necessary. We should rather rely on the fact that `countSourceCols` will be called in the `updateColumnsMapper` function only when the `columnsMapper

`neve-tansparent-header` is not a valid CSS class. Please check if the class is correctly spelled.
@Eric89GXL Can you please add a note in the docstring to explain the difference between `reg_decoded_bbox=True` and `reg_decoded_bbox=False`?
I'm not sure if this is the right way to do this. The base class is not a derived class of the `IExporter` class.
"Could not save key config: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '...'"
This is wrong, you can also have at-least-once delivery.
This seems like a pretty specific use case. Wouldn't it be better to add this to the `node` struct instead of introducing a new function?
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
Is this going to break anyone who has a relative path?
sqlalchemy could not be imported, db_task_history will not work
I think it's better to return a string constant here instead of a literal string.
This is not right. We're fuzzing user namespace UID mappings, not UID mappings in general.
Is this header needed?
I think this is the right fix, but I'm not sure what this code is doing.
I think it would be clearer to say "can't coexist with ToAddresses".
I'm not sure this is correct. We are filtering on the last per subject, but then starting at the next message?
Is this really necessary?
Is this class really needed?
I'm not sure this is needed, but I don't have a strong opinion either way.
This is a very good point. We should probably just have the new code always replace the old code, and then it's not an issue.
Please add `@param {string} config - Optional config to override the default config.

@john-janin @Eric-Arellano I'm not sure if we should be bumping the version number here, or if we should be using the semantic versioning for this.
#if TRUE
@adamjstewart I think I need to update this test to match the new output.
I think you can use `Input.DEFAULT_LOCKTIME_SEQNUMBER` directly here.
I think it should be called `create_pause_action` to be consistent with the `create_action` method
I don't think this change is necessary, and it doesn't seem to have any effect.
Why not just `q := &blockRetrievalQueue{...` ?
Shouldn't this be `continue` instead of `break`?
nit: This test is failing because it is not checking the result of the `string_trim` function. It is only checking the result of the `trim` function.
Why is this necessary?
I think this is not needed, since the `comparator.compare(this.struct, that.struct) == 0` will do the same check.
I'm not sure this is the right abstraction here. This method is called from `AbstractServiceClient` which is a `ServiceClient` implementation. I think we should instead expose a `StreamingDescriptors` interface in `ServiceClient` and implement it in `AbstractServiceClient`. This way,
@xuehui1991 Can you please remove this line?
I think you need to add the scale back in. The test fails if you don't.
I'm not sure if this is a good test case. I'm not sure if the test should test that the value is not modified, or that the value is modified.

Should this be `json:"max_payload_size"`?
Unnecessary import.
I don't understand why this is needed. I thought the parser would ignore the field and not report an error.
@liangyx-qf this line is causing the issue.
I think this is a bug. The metric is called `PingTime` but it is being used to measure the time it takes to ping an underlay.
TODO: use generic container
7 is the maximum length of the SHA-1 hexadecimal hash, which is 40 characters long.
Is there a reason to use `Kill` here? If the process is not responding to shutdown request, then I think we should just kill it.
Do we need to include Blacklight::Facet here?
I'm not sure if we should use `0` as the default value here. We can use `0` for all new tables, but if we want to add new fields in the future, we should use `null` as the default value.
I think this should be `lower(CAST(' . $translationsAlias . '.value as CHAR))`
@wachterjohannes why is the entity manager still in use?
I think it's a good idea to make the component name configurable, but I think we should also keep the default as `analytics` to keep the code consistent.
Style/StringLiterals: Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
This TODO is not needed anymore, right?
There are some cases when neg_prob = 0. This will cause the neg_prob.log() to be inf without clamp.

I'm wondering if we should make this a bool and have it default to true. It's not clear to me that the bearer token file is optional.
this is a breaking change
The tabindex is set to -1, which means it won't be clickable.
It seems like the error returned from `GetOrCreateRepoAndID` should be returned here, and `GetRepoAndID` should just be a no-op in this case.
I think this should be `directConnection` instead of `directConnection`
I'm wondering if we should be checking if the title is not empty instead of checking if it's not undefined.
this is not a good fix. if we don't want to do it this way, then we should fix the code in `showBrowseStep` to accept a null allowedExtensions.
@christopherhahn @mjkkirschner @stephentoub @JeremyKuhne @stephentoub - I have added the `framework` parameter to the method. I'm not sure if this is the right way to go about it, but it'
I think this is a no-op now.
appTypeFlag is now called svcTypeFlag.
The file has 3 header lines that contain, for each field, the name, type, and a special indicator for those fields that serve as the reset field, sequence id field, and timestamp field. The other fields
Looks like this test is unused?
I would call this `ServerStreamHandler` or `StreamHandler`
Can we use `get()` instead of `current()` here?
Please add empty line between imports and the first usage of a class.
This will result in an error. The error will be logged twice.
I think it should be `kmsAliasPrefix` (no `s`)

@lloydhawkes I think this is the only part that I'm not sure about. The problem is that the names of the groups can be anything, so the set of group names will not be unique.
This is the only part of the PR that I'm not sure about. I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it. If you have a better idea, please let me know.
Layout/AlignParameters: Align the parameters of a method call if they span more than one line.
Please use `Objects#equals` instead.
This is not needed anymore.
This is the wrong way around. If the inner type has a name, we should use that, otherwise we should use the default.
I think we should also do this for the `Function` case.
I think this should be ReleaseLevel.ALPHA.UNSET_RELEASE_LEVEL.UNSET_RELEASE_LEVEL.ALPHA.UNSET_RELEASE_LEVEL.ALPHA.UNSET_RELEASE_LEVEL.ALPHA.UNSET_RELEASE
Why do we need this change? I don't think we need to check for this feature when it's not enabled.
I'm not sure what this was doing, but it looks like it's not needed.
I don't think we need this.
The default task group name should be something more generic. It should be something like `copilot-default-task-group` or something like that.
Manage Consent types
Settings.JSONBoolWithQuotes(DEFAULT_JSON_USE_QUOTES); // The quotes here are redundant, as the default value is false.
Is this change necessary?
this is a breaking change, so it should be reverted
I think it's fine to leave this in, since it's a public API.
@pablolarrinaga this is a good idea. I'm thinking about how to make it more explicit. Maybe we should use the name of the column that caused the error.
Is this a style issue?
This one is a little confusing, since the method returns a table but the return type is `Table.Builder`.
This should be an error, as it is not a warning.
Please add a new line here.
is it a typo? bhTarget -> noencTarget
This is the "new" Input. I'm not sure why it is called from_definition, since it's not being called from a definition.

@ClémentFournier, do you mind adding the copyright year in the header?
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, as it will make the code harder to understand. I'd prefer to have this in a separate file.

The old code has been replaced by a new version of the same code, which is not correct.
Please rename the key `db.name` to `db.database_name` to match the existing key names.

This seems to be a constant, and should be static final.
/examples/bundle/ghost-logo.png:100%
It looks like the else clause was unintentionally removed.
Can we add a description here?
I think it would be better to use a different variable name, because this one is already used in the map cache class.
I think we can remove this line
I think it would be better to check if it's not empty.
I think it's a little confusing to have two different options here: 'disable' and 'python3'. I'd suggest renaming 'python3' to 'disable_python3' or something like that.

This is a breaking change, so we should either add a TODO or a note about it.
I'm not sure if this is the best way to do this. What if we pass a function to formatDate instead of a string?
I think this message is a bit confusing, as it does not explain what is wrong. I would say something like: "Unknown advert position name 'X'. Known names are 'Y', 'Z'."
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
Why we remove this line?
I don't think this is the right fix. The problem is that the comparator is not serializable, so the serialization is broken. You need to fix the comparator to be serializable.
Please remove the extra whitespace.
`setPrefWidth` is now `setMaxWidth` and `setPrefHeight` is now `setMaxHeight`.

I'd suggest something like `No implementation for ListDeploymentConfigTemplates.`
@pstibrany @jglick @slavkap @garyrussell @josegar84 @slavkap @michaelkuhn @davidjumani - this is a change to the docker agent. It was introduced to avoid having to add ENI trunk
A transaction may change an account's SpendingKey to "re-key" the account.
This is a great example of how `dom.isFocusable` can be used.
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
Raw input is: {'key': 'value', 'field': 'value'}
This is going to cause a lot of contention, and I'm not sure it's worth it. It seems like this lock should only be held for the duration of the logParams() call.
The variable name hPreferredName is a bit misleading. I think it should be hPreferredTlfName.
I'm wondering if we should have a `PaymentChannelInfo` that includes `State` and `Vouchers`. This is just to avoid having to pass `State` and `Vouchers` around as separate values.
This will be very confusing to the user. It's like saying, "This is the fast sync lag for the beam, but it's not the fast sync lag for the beam." It's better to use a descriptive name for this enum.
@rhtyds I'm not sure about the `@NotNull` annotation here. The `monitor` is not null, but the `monitor` may be an empty `DBRProgressMonitor`.
This has the following format: <minimum_bug_path_length>:<maximum_bug_path_length>. Valid values are: "\"4:10\", \"4:\", \":10\""
Nit: this is not necessary, it's the default behavior.

This variable should be named `_vectorSize` to be consistent with the rest of the code.

@david-lloyd I think you'll need to make sure this doesn't leak into the public API.
The Forseti blacklist rules engine agent is a nice name. I wonder if we should make this the default user agent for all requests.
This is the most confusing part of the CLI, and I'm not sure it's better than the current CLI output.
@michaelkuhn: I'm curious what your thoughts are on the change here. I believe this is a case where we're calling kill() on the process and then waiting for it to terminate. Is there a reason why we're not just calling wait() here?

I don't think we should be changing the behavior of this method, we should keep it as is.
It is not a file descriptor, it is a file-like object.
`i !== dom.value || (newVNode.type === 'progress' && !i)` is the same as `i !== dom.value`
I'm not sure if we need to do this, but we could probably remove the `mimeTypes` array, and use `mime.lookup(file.name)` instead.
This is a bit of a change, but we are going to try to make this change to all the ViewModels.
This file should be in `flux/test/test_packages.go`
`isInFocusOrder` is a better name for this method.
I think this should be removed as well.

`administerable_by?` is defined in `Administerable`.
We can probably remove the "None" here, since we don't expect any user to pass security_groups=None.
This is wrong. The pull is still valid. It just needs to be inserted at the end of the list.

The "FIXME" is not clear. What do you want to do in the case of error?
This is a breaking change, so I'd expect to see some sort of deprecation period here.

This should be in the package, not in the main function.
This is the only change I'm not really sure about. The reason for this is that the mediaContext is not defined in the media entity. So I'm not sure how to get it in this case. Maybe I should just remove the `$mediaContext` from the `getMediumFormatsAction`

I don't think this change is necessary.
I think this should be "cache cert on disk" for both versions.
@nvazquez I think this should be false by default.
I think this is unrelated to the rest of the PR, but it's a bug fix so I didn't want to create a separate PR.
Is this error message correct? It seems to me that it would be better to panic with the option name.

This is not necessary, the fragment can be added directly to the adapter.

nit: `proposalID` is already set in line 106
I think this should be `time.time()` instead of `int(time.time())`
This is the only instance where we're not using the same class as the parent class, so it seems like it's worth fixing to be consistent.
> return "("; [](start = 4, length = 2) This is not a good change. The "(" is part of the syntax for function calls. I'm not sure if it should be in jx_print_subexpr or here.
Can we add a warning here instead?
Nit: I think this error should be `SerializationError`
"renewBefore is bigger than the set duration": {
I'm wondering if we can remove the `IsProcessBackground` function entirely. We're not using it anywhere else, and the only thing it does is call `os.Kill` if we're in the background process group. Maybe we can just call `os.Kill` directly?
Is this necessary? If we're not using the client hello, it's not needed.

`getStatusCode` returns the HTTP status code.

Is this going to be a common pattern? If so, it might be worth extracting it to a helper function.
I'm not sure if it is a good idea to put the code in the test class. If you have a test class, you have to instantiate it and call the methods. I would suggest to put the code in a function in the test class.

@ruddell I think it's fine, since the `Dataverse` is a subclass of `Dataset`.
I don't think this is necessary.
@davidbeckingsale I'm wondering if this is the right way to do it. I think it's not a good idea to add this to the key bindings, because it will break the "select all" feature.
this is not a good idea. I'd rather have a test case for this.
I don't think this is right, since the cgroup manager is only used for v2 cgroups. I think we should just check if the cgroup is frozen in the `c.cgroupManager.Freeze` call.

The news.google.com feed is not a real feed.
This is a change in behavior. Before, the local variable was called `initValue` (or `variable` if it was a random variable), and now it's called `entityValue`. This is a breaking change. Should we have a new configuration parameter for the name of the local variable?
This seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure how it will work in practice. It will mean that a node can't connect to a node that is only listening on IPv4, which might be a problem for some nodes.
I'm not sure this is the right place to test for this. I think it should be in the constructor of the test analyzer.
The description of this test is a bit misleading, it should be "TrivialTestSlasher does nothing, but counts the number of times it's called."
I'm not sure if this is the right fix, but it's the only one I could come up with.

@andrewkim2001 this is the path for the model and work_dir
why we don't use the same logic as before?
`birthDate` is a `Date` object, not a `moment` object. You need to call `moment(birthDate).toDate()`
@deads2k this is a breaking change, as it was removing the labels.
this should be a warning. It is ok for the user to run this command in the console, but it is not ok for the user to run this command in the docker container.
This is a bit confusing, but I guess it's fine.
Use `File.exist?` instead of `File.exist?(first_runs_free)`
I'm not sure this is the best solution. The "Date created" label is only used in the "Recent" view. In the other views, the "Date created" column is named "Created". The "Date changed" label is only used in the "Recent" view. In the other
I'm not sure about the naming here. Maybe `LoaderSaver` is more clear.
Is it possible to make this a separate PR? I think it's a good idea, but not part of this PR.
I don't think this is the right place to change the `it->first` to `it->second`
I think it would be better to just have the error monitor set the desired failure msg once, instead of repeating it.
Please use `size_t` instead of `std::int64_t`.

I would use a method like `isDownloadable()` instead of `fileExists()` to be more consistent with the other menu items.
I'm not sure if this is the right translation for this message. Maybe we should translate it to "New Message Block".
This change seems unrelated.
I don't think we should be using `apply()` here. `commit()` is the preferred method for `SharedPreferences`
I would prefer the use of const references here.
Is there a reason for this change?
@wachterjohannes: I'm not sure if this is the best way to do this. Maybe you have a better idea?
why is this here?
I think it's better to use `enable.quartz.scheduler` or `enable.quartz.job.scheduler` to avoid confusion.
This should be `cloud.google.com/go/cloudevents/cloudevents#SourceSpec`
nit: this can be done in a single line, with a f-string
I don't think we want to add this script to the default WordPress install. It's meant to be used for debugging and is not necessary for the plugin to work.
You should use `reset` here
This is a method of the control, so you don't need the underscore prefix.
This should be `if (getSupportActionBar() != null) {`
Add an appropriate name for your guidance group. This name will be used to tell the end user where the guidance has come from. It will be appended to text identifying the theme e.g. "[guidance group name]: guidance on data sharing" so we suggest you just use the institution or department name
this line is wrong, it should be true.
Nit: `NewClient` takes an optional `Config` parameter, so we could pass that here instead of passing a `nil` config.
$options: String
@jwarsaw I'm not sure if this is the right approach, but I think it's the easiest way to make this work. The idea is that the OrcValueWriter is the only writer that needs to be used for this writer.
Is this a breaking change? I can't see any test case for this.
This is a breaking change. Is it intentional?
If the path contains characters that the locale cannot handle, then we consider it as non-existent.
Nit: can we use `errors.Is()` instead of `errors.Cause()` here?
@samsondavis can you confirm that this is correct?
I think it's better to put them in `pkg/constants.go`
Why is this needed?
This is not correct. The value should be null or undefined.

Didn't this need to be `h` as well?
Why are these sleeping?

I don't think this is the right way to do this. We need to make sure we are not hardcoding the more icon names.

This is a very strange place to have a log entry, but I guess it's the only place we have.
This is the only place in the code where we are unlocking the lock. It's not really a big deal but it seems like it would be cleaner to have the unlocking of the lock be done inside the lock.lock() and lock.unlock() calls.
import de.danoeh.antennapod.core.preferences.UserPreferences;
This struct needs a field which represents the size of sectors that this miner has committed. For now, sector size is configured by the StorageMarketActor's ProofsMode.
Please revert this change
This is a bit weird. If the user does not provide the new value, the field will be updated to the default value. This is not the case for other fields, e.g. the checkbox.
The `ThreadAgnostic` property should be set to `false` by default.
This is a bit confusing. The protected mode is a different mode, not just a flag to indicate whether or not the function is protected. I would suggest to remove the protected mode and instead have a flag that indicates whether or not to push the return value.
We're below 30 secs. That's awesome!
outputs[0].shape = torch.Size([1, 11, 340, 340])
I'm not sure we want to hard code this, but it's a good start.

@homedir_file || {:level => 'sixth', :ssh => {:auth_methods => 'auth_home_123'}}
I think this file is still not ready to merge.
Why not constexpr?
I don't think this is the correct value for this parameter. I think it should be set to 0. I'm not sure why it's set to 1 here.
I think we should keep the `sign_in` route as is, since that's what the user expects.
I think it would be better to add the MPI module to the end of the list, since the MPI module is the last module to be initialized.
Nit: "PreserveUnknownFields" should be "PreserveUnknownFields"
I think we can just use `w.ID()` here and below.
Why do we need to set the `vnode` to `null`?
@ruddell - this file is not being updated. I am not sure if this is the right file.
This is the only place that uses the `_path_suggestion` variable. It's not used in any other file, so I think we can just rename it to `download_path_suggestion`.
This is not the case for now.
This test is no longer needed, because it is covered by the other tests in this class.

Is it possible to be rootless and not have any cgroup paths?
I think it would be better to have a function that creates a replacer and calls it here. That way you can reuse the function in other places.
parameter name used to pass in parameterized value. Defaults to None, meaning use first positional parameter
//clumsy-stefan: what's this for? //clumsy-stefan: what's this for?
I'm not sure this change is needed. The code is using the Remote version of the method because the `Trace` package is a package that implements the `Remote` interface. I don't think the code is doing anything special here, just using the `Remote` version of the method.
This method is not being used, and is no longer required.
I think this is not necessary. We can just import DataTable.
I'm not sure if we want to remove these methods from the interface, since we still need to implement them in the protocols.
Why is this necessary?
Why not just rename it to `TracerProviderBuilder` and add `Sdk` to the `TracerProviderBuilder` class?
test_pool.py:1:1: E122: Unused import: 'graphite.worker_pool.pool'

I don't think this should be public. I'm not sure if it's safe to call this from the outside.
This is a bit of a useless message.
I think you can remove the comma here.
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundModuleBody: Extra empty line detected at module body end.
`id` is the value of the `id` field of the `flag` entity.
This class is now public, and should be annotated with `@VisibleForTesting`.
Nit: this function name is a bit awkward. Maybe `BuildFromLocalDockerfileRequired`?
This looks like it's missing a space after the `i`.
`logger` is a public property, it should not be serialized.
The `onStartSendRequest` method is called twice.
This is the change that I think is causing the problem.

@tomspilman is this still valid?
I think it's better to have this in a constant in `kinto/config.py` so that it's used in all places.
I think this should be done in the call to `PKG_CHECK_MODULES`.
Layout/ExtraSpacing: Unnecessary spacing detected.<br>Layout/SpaceBeforeFirstArg: Put one space between the method name and the first argument.
This is not the correct way to determine the size of a signed message. The size of the message is stored in the `Message` field, not the `Signature` field.
/home/ubuntu/tigera/tigera-authz/tigera-authz/cmd/server/main.go:28:2: no files found in package "server"
I don't think we need this function. If we want to support other package registries in the future, we can just add them to the base class.
proxy host: [host] port: [port]
Line is too long. [83/80]
This is not necessary. The working directory is already set in the constructor of the GeneralCommandLine.
I'm not sure if this is the right way to handle this. If we want to support multiple formats, then this should be a set of formats. If we want to only support one format, then this should be an enum. I'm not sure if there's a good middle ground.
Why do we need to cast to Long?
I think it's better to use the flow key to do synchronization, rather than the flow itself. The flow itself is a mutable object, and synchronization on it is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.
The merged cell declared at [row, col] overlaps with the other declared merged cell. The overlapping merged cell was not added to the table, please fix your setup.
I think we can simplify this a bit: `opts.java_primitive_has_method = arg == "--java_primitive_has_method";`
Is this a hard limit?
No need to change this file.
MaxIPSetSize int
This is the wrong change.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea. If the amount is negative, the action should be rejected, but I'm not sure if this is the case here.
I'm not sure about this method name. It seems to me that it's not clear what it returns. Maybe we should have a method called getEditedProducts and it should return an array of products that were edited at least once. What do you think?
I don't think this is correct. We're assuming that the app is using HTTP/2 to stream data, but we're not doing anything to ensure that. We should do something to ensure that, and then the code below can be removed.
I think this is a bug fix.
This is a bit of a hack, but I'm not sure how to do this more elegantly. I'm not sure if the GPU vendor name is always the first thing in the model string, or if it varies by GPU vendor.
This needs to be marked as non-nullable.
Nit: `err` is not needed in the signature.
Unused method argument - email. If it's an optional argument, use _ or _email as an argument name to indicate that it won't be used.
@smarterclayton This is a bit of a nit, but it's good practice to use lowercase names for constants.
import pandas_wraps from databricks.koalas.typedef import pandas_wraps from databricks.koalas.sql import sql
Shouldn't this be `Node\NullableType`?
@wachterjohannes I'm wondering why you changed this. The `BIND` event is called when the form is bound to the data, and the `SUBMIT` event is called when the form is submitted.
This line was not needed.
The reason why we have to use the string literal is because we're trying to keep the file size small.
I think we should be more explicit here and say "must specify AWS platform for compute machine sets"
Please add a TODO here, that we need to handle this properly in the future.

@derekjones I don't know why this is the default, but I guess it's better to make it false by default.
I think we should use `self.global_configs` instead of `global_configs` here.
Use %i or %I for an array of symbols.
"none" is not a valid value for a string.
I don't think this is right. duration_ms is not a string. It's a float.
I think this is a typo.
`+ 4 /* aligned bools */` is redundant
This is a bugfix. I think this was an oversight in the original code.
This is not a regex, so this will not match.
HiveConf is not thread safe.
Please remove this space.
I'm not sure about this change, because it looks like we're not using `dummyyyloc` and `dummyyylval` anymore.
Can you add a note here about why the icon is being changed?
I think we can remove the onBehalfOf param from this method and just use the accountId
The `services` parameter should be a list.
@smarterclayton This is the change that allows us to remove the ID from the DestroySender struct and make the ID an attribute of the Session struct.
I'm not sure about this change. The config file is still being written to the app root, and this change makes it impossible to use a custom config path.
nit: could be `K9.isQuietTimeEnabled()`
`t._1` is an Object, not a String.

This is the only directive I have added to the directives.php file. I thought it would be nice to have the output of the query in the output.
Shouldn't this be `PersistBlockLevelInfo` instead of `PersistBlockLevelInfoHash`?
This is not the right error message. I think you want "can't unmarshal count field into task count or auto scaling config"
I don't think this is correct, it should be `auto comm = world_comm_ptr{new lbann_comm(0), &lbann::finalize };`
Why did you remove the empty line here?
Is there a way to wait for all the informers to finish syncing?
#Copyright (C) 2006-2019 NV Access Limited, Peter Vágner, Aleksey Sadovoy, Joseph Lee
This change is a no-op because we always output the error message as well as the output.
I'm not sure about removing this. It is the only way to set the id field.
Should we make this an optional parameter?
I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but I think this should be `Interface interfaze` instead of `Interface interfaze`.
@bartonjs - I'm curious if this will be useful for the parent process. I'm thinking it might be better to just use the process id of the parent process and not the child process.
Unnecessary wildcard import

@JordanRaisbeck I think the description here should be changed to: "Account to be used by the block author / coinbase, to be loaded from keystore"
nit: can we use a const?

Use `join` instead of `merge`.
I'm not sure this change is right. The idea is that a target that is not runnable and has multiple outputs can be used as a dependency. So, for example, if I have `target1 -> target2 -> target3`, I can't use `target1` as a dependency.

This message is a bit misleading. We're not detecting AVX-512 code in use, but rather that the processor is AVX-512 capable. We're not actually running any AVX-512 code at this point.
This was removed because the instrumentation was not working.
This interface is only used by the automatic tracer, so we can make it internal.
This is a breaking change, as it will change the way the command line is built. It is needed because the `managed-domain` resource has no `--provider` flag. I'm not sure if this is a good change or not, as the previous behavior was to pass `--provider=aws` to the
@stevekuznetsov @slavkap I'm not sure about this one. It's a bit of a nitpick, but I feel like it's a bit of a stretch to say that we "failed" to create an output stream. I think we just "didn'
@KonajuStudio - This was the issue with the `VK_EXT_descriptor_update_template` tests. The `commandBuffer` was not the same as the `commandBuffer` in the barrier.

I don't think this is correct. The Hive client is not thread-safe, and is created once per connection. So, it is safe to delete it after the connection is closed.
I think this should be kept.
"java chassis unable know invocation type before starting process" -> "java Chassis is unable to know the invocation type before starting the process"
This is a very weird way to do it. We don't want to be leaking env vars. Why not just set it in the package?
I don't think we should be changing the order here. It's possible that some callers will expect the order to be the same as the API.

nit: no need to add this here, since it's already in the `require` statement.
I think you can remove this line, and just put it in the list above.

I think this is a bit confusing, as it's not clear to me that escaping is only used for writes.
Nit: these should be `const`s
IMPORT_JANGLE is a bit misleading... maybe something like IMPORT_JAVA_COMMON?
Is this really the right value?
import "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors"
Is this really a pub? I would expect this to be a SUB.
@mfojtik, @mheon @rhatdan I am not sure if we need to set the default to "LOG_DRIVER" here, as we already have a default in the SecretTarget.
This check is a bit redundant since we're already checking for a non-null plugin above.
width and height are not supported by the API, so we don't need to add them here.
I think this should be `_targetDbForSaves` instead of `_targetDb`
This is a little confusing, but I think it's fine. The `Tag` is not necessarily the last tag that was set for the block. It's the last tag that was set for the block by the `Prefetcher`. It's the last tag that was set for the block that
I'm not sure this is correct, since the `Start` method is used in `inbound.New`, and `New` is called by `Inbound` in `NewInbound`
I'm not sure what the correct behavior is here. I think we want to add inventory to the list of options that are not included in the output. I think that's what we're doing now, but I'm not sure.
This is a little confusing. The difficulty bomb is not a "delay" but rather a "halting". I would call this something like "Difficulty Bomb Halting".

I think this should be called `cleanExpiredFiles` (or `cleanExpired` for short).
Style/StringLiterals: Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
I'm not sure about this. The reducer could return a different value, but the state is still the same. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
This is not the right fix. The problem is that `to_replace` is a `dict` with `replace` method. `replace` expects a list. `to_replace` is a dict, so it needs to be converted to a list.
Requests from here go to the host of the parent shard, and are processed by @link.
@bryceandrews this is the only change in this PR, but I think it is needed to fix the problem you identified.
I'm not sure if we should add the `skipLogOnErr` to the `Build` function. I think we can do it by checking the `err` in the `Build` function.
Should this be a `log.Debugf`?
I think you should use the exception.

I'm a bit concerned that the caller of `Log` may not pass in the correct `overrideEnableDebug` value, and that this could cause a bug. Maybe it's better to just always enable debug logging?

This is a breaking change. If we want to change the type of the column, we should use the migration utility.

This method is called from `remove()` method. I think we can just call `remove()` from here.

I'm not sure if this is right. I think this is the number of threads that were active at the time of the last call to `profile_begin_basic_block()`. It might be better to just call `profile_get_num_threads()` here.

This is not a thread role, it is a transaction type.

You can simplify this to `($this->min_bound === null || $this->max_bound >= $i) || ($this->min_bound <= $i)`
nit: this can be simplified to `literalSet.stream().anyMatch(v -> !eq(ref, toLiteral(v)))`

@jglick what do you think about removing this?
This is the same check that was previously done in `consumer.go`. I think it's a bit weird to have two checks for the same thing, but this one is better because it's more accurate.
Is there a reason why we are including wav files?
This file is now empty.

Can you add the `Accountable` type to the class name?
Please move this to a separate PR.
This is a bit of a problem. We're now importing a module from the same directory as the current one, which is a bit odd. I think it would be better to move the HRNet module to the same directory as the `torchvision` module.
These events are only used by the VariableMap, so we should not expose them to the user.

This option doesn't seem to be used anywhere.

I don't think this is correct. `Blockly.localConnection_` is only set for blocks that are not connected to anything, so it should be checked only if `Blockly.highlightedConnection_` is not set.

Can you make this `auto nested_type = nested->type.struct_def;` and remove the `auto nested_type_name = WrapInNameSpace(*nested_type);` below?
This one should be deleted.
This should be removed.
Is there a reason why the stride is being changed?
The `@since` should be `v2.1.0`.
usie -> use
Why are these values changing?
I'm not sure if we need to remove this file. It's still being used by the agent.
I think we should update the status here as well.
This is a great example of a place where we could use a proper AWS SDK for Java client to do the work for us. I'm not sure if we're using it for this class, but we could definitely do it for the DeleteServerCertificate method.
This sentence doesn't seem to have anything to do with the sentence that follows it.
@smarterclayton @david-hill I think this is the fix.
This seems wrong, you're still calling AbsolutePath on the string that is empty.
This is not a RESTful endpoint. I'd expect this to be a GET method in a different class, and I'd expect the endpoint to be `/api/termsOfUse`
Can you remove this import?
nit: can you remove the extra spaces here and below?
Can you please change this to `image` instead of `icon`? The latter sounds like it would be a CSS class name, but the former is a more common term for an image.
I think this sentence is a bit misleading. I think it's better to say that `java.lang.Object` is not included by default.
This is a bit of a nit, but we don't need to do this. The lock is acquired and released in a single operation.
This is a change in formatting, which should be reverted.
[WITH_MODERN_GRUB] = yes
The mode that presents text in a flat representation that can be navigated with the cursor keys like in a text document
Why not just return the bool?
This should be const char*
This should be `subprocess.run`
Should we add this to the `market` package?
This module wraps the SHGetFolderPath function in shell32.dll and defines the necessary contstants.
Yes, you need to implement `getStartBlock` here.
Please remove this line.
9bf9752a-54a2-451a-a541-444add56f96b
`doSync` is a bit confusing, I'd suggest `sync` instead.
I think this constant should be prefixed with "write." so it's clear that it's for the write metadata.
Why do we need this?
This is a bit of a nitpick, but I'd prefer `DO_NOT_RENDER_RECURSIVELY` over `NO_RENDER` as the name.
Why do we need a new path?
why not just use len(name) - suffixLength?
@cramforce @jridgewell I am trying to get this working. I am not sure why it is failing.
> `loopdev` and `ramdisk` options are ignored for now
Please revert the changes in this file.
The `pipeline_name` is a bit misleading. This name is not related to the name of the pipeline.
`Queue` is not an abstract class, so `AbstractQueue` is not needed.
This is a HIP error code.
staticbuild must be true or false
Nit: This line is unrelated to the rest of the change.
"rclone/1.41 (linux-amd64) libcurl/7.61.0"
I'm not sure if it makes sense to call this Options, since it's not really an option.
The type of the return value depends on the region and cannot be determined in advance.
NIT: this should be a test for a real MDC
@jkwatson @garyrussell @jglick @samsondavis @nmittler I'm not sure about this. We should probably get some more input from other members of the community.
I think it would be good to have a more descriptive FIXME here.
#include "actions.h" #include "movement.h" #include "weapons.h" #include "globalevent.h" #include "events.h"
@Pearl1594 can you please check this change, it looks like it will break the flow status when the flow is stopped due to pod failure.

Why is this not using the new API?
The package name should be `org.phoenicis.javafx.components.library.ui` and the class name `LibraryDetailsPanels`
Please move the `autoRowSize` config to `handsontableOptions` and use `autoRowSize.rowHeight` instead of `plugin.heights[0]`.
I'm not sure what to return here.
Please remove the extra new line here.
I'm not sure this is a good idea. It's not guaranteed that the entropy is low, so you might end up with a very high counter value, which will make the test pass but the signature is still bad.
Is it possible to have an RPC name but no RPC address?
Line is too long. [82/80]
Is it possible to have a test case for this?
Nit: This is not the same error message.
nit: no need to allocate the memory on the stack
This is the only change required to make the tests work.
This file is not under Apache License, but MIT.
I think we should reserve these two as well.
I think this should be {{- if .IsSymlink }} {{- else if .IsDir}}
This line is not needed.
This import is unused.
If this is going to be used in the future, maybe we should add it to the WorkflowLoggable interface?
`location` is never used, please remove it.
I think this is still needed, since it is used by the `init()` method.
Can we call this `PurgeRelaxedReclaim` or something similar? I think `Purge` implies a more aggressive action than what we're doing here.
'show or out during test only support ' \<add>batch size of 1'
This is an expensive check. I think it's better to move it into the `TransformResult::isTransformable` method.
nit: these tests don't seem to be using `CLITestType`
> Realm already opened at a different schema version [1] {schemaVersion: 1, schema: []}
This is not an error, it's just a notification.
failed to update image, image-provider=docker
\n
nit: remove empty line
I'm not sure what this example is trying to show. It's not clear to me what the variable is or what the purpose of the example is.
I think the last sentence is a bit confusing. The offsets are returned in ascending order, but they are used to determine the boundaries of scan tasks?
Toggle caret selection mode.
tests for missing-param-doc and missing-type-doc for Numpy style docstrings with accept-no-param-doc = no
I'm a bit worried about this. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to change the permissions on a file that's being used by other processes. I think it might be better to just change the permissions on the directory that the file is in.
@jordan39 this is the only place in the file that needs to be changed.
I'm not sure why this was here.
Line is too long. [102/80]
`pos` is always positive, so this is redundant.
This is the same as the previous line.
I'm not sure if this is the right way to do this.
@johanstehlin @alalazo can you take a look at this? I'm not sure if it's the best way to do this.
The try/except is not necessary here.
Nit: "up to" is not the same as "at most"
Is this line correct?
This is a minor nitpick, but `forEach` is a more idiomatic way to iterate over arrays.
Why do we need to convert nodeKey to identity.Identity?
I'm not sure about this change. It seems like it's changing the behavior of the function.
I think this is the bug.
This was a bug in the original code, it should have been ordering by ProtocolCode first and then by version.
@marek-lisak @bryanp @jgamblin @jimis @mjkkirschner @chriswright-intel @tlauda @matt-gardner @tlauda @mjkkirschner @chriswright-
nit: you could just use the `literalLoggable` type directly here
I think this is more accurate, but maybe it's not very clear.
if init_cfg is not None:  # init_cfg priority > pretrained
I'm not sure if we want to expose this to the user. I'm not sure if we should make it a public type or not.
This should be `keybase1.UID`
I don't think this will work on Travis. You need to use `tar xJf /tmp/#{r_filename} -C /usr/local/bin` to install the package.
This should be in a separate commit, as it's not related to the other changes.
Please don't use wildcard imports.
this is not a public method, please remove it
`StringSliceEqual` isn't really the right name for this function, is it?
Can you make this `auto nested_type = nested->type.struct_def;` and remove the `auto nested_type_name = WrapInNameSpace(*nested_type);` below?
import "github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node/config/remote"
`countly.events.views.js` should be removed
NIT: I think this should be `AspnetRouteTemplateResourceNamesEnabled = IsFeatureFlagEnabled(ConfigurationKeys.FeatureFlags.AspnetRouteTemplateResourceNamesEnabled, true);`
I think we should be more explicit about this, and explain that it's to avoid the error.
This file is now unused.
@jridgewell is this what you meant by "fixing the `value` prop"?
I'm not sure if we should be exposing this. I think it's fine to expose it for now, but I'd like to make sure we don't do anything that we're not expecting.
This is the only change in this PR.
Is this used anywhere?
Unnecessary newline.
The `x-gtar` is not a valid archive type.
CARAFE time forward: 10.1 ms/iter | time backward: 10.1 ms/iter
I don't see why we would ever want to copy an object that is not a Date. Is there a use case for this?
This is confusing. If the transactional catalog is not used, this will be a non-transactional table, right? If so, this will be a non-transactional table, and the refresh will be bounded by the visibility that the IsolationLevel of the thread exposes.
>ScanProvider.FileExists [](start = 49, length = 32) This is a very nice addition. Thanks!
I'm not sure what this is supposed to do?
Should this be "tests/" or "..\com_github_google_flatbuffers\tests\"?
why remove this?
I'm not sure about this constant, because we have 3 levels in total.
I don't understand why we need to copy this to a new struct. Why can't we just update the struct in the original function?
Unused import.
This seems a little high. It's ok to make it 1.20 or something like that, but I don't think 1.15 is a good idea.
I think we should use `ks.DatetimeIndex` here.
Shouldn't this be a check for null?
Why change this?
Line is too long. [105/80]
Please don't change the version number.
Will always be 1.0.
Please add the same rule for GRE.
Is this a separate PR? If so, can you link to it?
This looks like it's the correct fix. I'm not sure why this is being called in the first place.
The storageAPI is no longer needed, so I removed it.
I think this was a leftover from a refactoring of the help output.
"description_with_tags_html", :trace_name => "my_trace_name", :trace_description => "my_trace_description", :tags => ["my_tag"]
Line is too long. [83/80]
Can we call this `importAllFromMnemonic` instead of `importAll`?
[{"name":"SpectrumGrid"},{"name":"SpectrumGridItem"}],
I think we should also add OPTIONS.
IHttpMinResponseDataRateFeature is not used
The docstring for the create_no_window argument is missing.
This is wrong. If it is the first residue in the chain, it should be 0.0.
import typing from typing import List, Tuple
I don't think this is correct. If the opaque region is empty, the surface is opaque.

Please use `strlcpy` to avoid buffer overflows.
why did you change this?
Parameter 'unmatchedSetting' does not exist in the current context.
is there a reason to add these? I would expect to see these values from the metrics.
I think you should be able to just use `not response_content_str.startswith('<!doctype html')`, as the previous code will always be `''` in this case.
I think this is not needed anymore, since the `metadataEntries` field is not used anymore.
This will never be `std::string::npos`, as `to_string` will return `std::string` in the first place.
Unpublished product created
@caglar10ur : Can you check if the key 'projects' is the right one here? I'm not sure if it's the one we use in the SDK.
@robertwb I'm trying to make this work on Windows, but it looks like the multiprocessing.shared_memory module is not available on Windows. I'm trying to figure out how to work around this.
Line is too long. [101/80]
tealLogicSigSize: logicsig program size too large: 1234567890 > 10000000000
nit: Blob -> B
I think it's more clear to say that "the broker is receiving too many requests from ingress" than "the broker is sending too many requests to PubSub".
This is a great name, but I'm not sure if we're using it correctly. We're storing the rule hashes in this map, but we're using the keys as the rule hashes, not the values.
nit: use `assertEquals`
Should this be `json:"external_cgroup,omitempty"`?
Should this be removed now?
I think we can remove this now.
- see: link
I think this should be `useAppendedSequenceNumber`
@smarterclayton is this the right way to do it?
This is a no-op, but I don't know if there's a better way to hold the root node in memory.
The request, Cancelled Proposal, has been cancelled. View This Request
This is not the right place for this.
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundClassBody: Extra empty line detected at class body end.
This change is not correct.
Unused import: org.openqa.selenium.grid.distributor.remote.RemoteDistributorTest
@agramfort, I'm wondering if it would be better to add `text_font_size` to `data` instead of `style` here? I think it's a little more consistent with how `font_size` is handled.
this should be 'PUT' as well
I'm not sure about this. I'm not sure if we should have this at all. If we do, it should be configurable.
This is the same as `nameof(IntegrationIds.AdoNet)` above.
This is the only change that I'm not 100% sure about. I don't know if it's necessary to flush the events. I'm not sure if it's a problem if we don't. I'm not sure if we should only flush the events that we
@nmittler I think the same applies here. I'd prefer to see a single line.
I think we should remove the stEWASMTests and runtimes from this list.
Unnecessary newline detected.
I'm not sure this is the right place to put it, it should be in the `if (req->res.content_length <= self->args.min_size)` block.
Is this change needed?
Nit: I think it's a little clearer to have the return type be a channel, like the other processor functions.
I think it's not necessary to add `/releases` group.
Please use import ordering.
Is this change intentional?
nit: This is not the only place where the `new std::string` is used. Could you please use `std::string(folly::to<std::string>(3002))` instead of `new std::string(folly::to<std::string>(3002))
Unnecessary spacing detected.
@benhalpern this is the fix for the "host" issue
"ERROR: this version didn't compile with HDF5 library, can't use HDF5\n";
This should be in the identityApi package.
This seems to be the only place where this is used. Is it worth making it a global?
Why do we need this change? It seems that it's just for the case when the server has closed the connection and we want to close all the push streams. But we can already do that by calling `h2o_http2_close_connection()` with the error code H2O_HTTP2
I think this is wrong, the `keyDown` method takes a `Keys` object, not a `char`.
Line is too long. [81/80]
Line is too long. [81/80]
this is the only one that should be kept, right?
Please add a TODO to update the name of the method
nil is the correct type for this field.
This should be a `SetTag` call.
This seems like a good idea, but it seems like it might be better to do this in the `replaceAcronyms` method. That way it's easier to see what the acronyms are and the logic is more clear.
Please use the following: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks; using AutoRest.Core.Validation; using AutoRest.Core.Validation.Validators; namespace AutoRest.Core.Validation { [Flags] public enum ValidationCategory

This is the only change I made to the code. I'm not sure if this is the right way to do this. I thought I would need to do this in order to have the genesis text available to the rest of the code.
Pretty print for response
This is a bit confusing to me. It seems like this is just a wrapper for `ipld.State` which is a struct, not a thing. I think we should use `ipld.State` directly.
This test will fail if we ever change the default parent process ID.
should be `===`
I don't see where the "TRUE" is used?
@throws IOException if an I/O error occurs.
<h1>Trace upload</h2>
The "NM" stands for "Not Member"
This class is deprecated. Use PMDException instead.
If config.AttackTimeout is 0, it should be set to protocol.DefaultAttackTimeout.
@tannergooding is this a breaking change? If so we should add a new property to the StepMetadata.
nit: This could be a regex, but I'm not sure it's worth it.
Why did you change the PhysicalLocationComponent to PhysicalLocation?
This change is a bit odd, but I think it's okay since the check for `spec.fields().isEmpty()` is already redundant with `spec.isUnpartitioned()`
I don't think we need to do this. The `crt` argument is the certificate object, and it already has a `Spec` field.
I think it would be better to keep the servers options as a separate option. This way, we can still run `caddy run --servers=foo` and get the help output.
This seems like a reasonable change, but I'm not sure if we want to change the semantics of this method. I think it was intended to be a check for the absence of the two keys, not the absence of a value.
"seen twice: " + info.info.name ;
I would prefer this over the Aggregate.
The second argument is not used.
tmp_optarg is a char * and not a wchar_t *
# Compute regression and classification targets for anchors.
@wachterjohannes I am not sure if this is the correct way to handle this. The code is a bit confusing, as it seems to me that this function should be used to get all products from the last processed ID onwards.
This one is the only one that actually needs to be changed.
I don't think we need to add the import here.
This should be `private final int fieldId;`
This seems to be unrelated.
@pabloem what is the difference between `ORDER_PATH` and `ORDER`?

Redundant return detected.
I think you mean `if qtutils.version_check('5.11.2', '5.12.0')`.
I'm not sure if this is correct. Shouldn't it be `DBL_MAX` so that it's the minimum distance between the two outputs?
You could use os.path.abspath() directly, no need for the join.
I think this should be const
@damencho I'm not sure about the default value. If we make it `false`, then it will prevent scrolling on table header. If we make it `true`, then it will prevent scrolling on table body. So, what do you think?
I think this should be a thread pool instead of a thread, but that's a different PR.
Missing specs for model Quiz
I think we should make this a bit more explicit and call it `spacing`.
Are these really needed? If they are, can we put them in a class-level variable instead of a static one?
IHttpParser
This should be `version.getVersion().toLowerCase().contains(searchTerm.toLowerCase())`
You can remove this line.
I think it's a good idea to use a dictionary here.
Can we add this to the validation package?
@matt-gardner @gabriel-jacobs @bryce-anderson @matt-gardner @gabriel-jacobs @bryce-anderson
Is it necessary to remove these?
is mean
this function doesn't need to be called from the goroutine
I'm not sure if this is a good place to put this logic, but it's probably a bit cleaner than the other option I considered, which was to do this in `materialize()`.
Outputs were already written to the output file in the previous for loop.
@matt-gardner I think it would be better to just have this be a Boolean param, rather than an enum. The reason is that we're not really transposing the layout in the sense that we're not actually changing the layout. We're just changing how the elements are ordered
ClockIds []string `json:"clockIds,omitempty"`
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundClassBody: Extra empty line detected at class body end.
I think it would be nice to have a little more context here, like: "Error! Environment creation failed: %v".

You are not authorized to access that page.
This is a bit confusing to me. If I want to update the mirrors, I want to update the mirrors. I don't want to do anything else. If I want to do something else, I'll do it.
nit: I'd put this on the same line as the if.
I'm not sure we should be using the bytes library here. I don't think we need it for the block header.
FailedToSend
This should be a different name. I'm not sure what it should be called, but it should be different.
This was the wrong way around.
This is the wrong place for this. It should be moved to the bottom of the list.
I'm a bit confused by this. The `LowestOutput` function in the Credential contract is not buggy. I think you're referring to the fact that the `LowestOutput` function in the `Cosmos` contract does not handle `int` outputs correctly.
Trailing whitespace detected.
%q is not a member of trust domain %q
I'm not sure why we're calling this "apply" now. It seems like we're just doing a join, not applying a resource.
Metrics/LineLength: Line is too long. [124/120]
`receiveSettings` is not a test function. I think we can use `render` here.
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea. I think that we should always use `str` to avoid problems with `int` vs `float` when comparing values.
@Qgil I think I found a problem. When the user selects an item in the completion list, the text is not shown. I'm not sure why. I tried changing the font, but that didn't work. I also tried adding `font-size: 100%;` to
Can you change this back to `github.com/gogo/protobuf/proto`?
Why is this added?
Line is too long. [105/80]
The name of the file is wrong. It should be `cascade_mask_rcnn_r50_fpn_20e_coco.py`.
I don't think this is right. I think the default should be `0` so that it's not waiting for blocks to arrive at all.
This is a bit weird, but it is the only way to make the docblock work for PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4.
can we just use `db` instead of `mutation.db`?
`nano::websocket::listener` should be moved into `nano::websocket` namespace
This is the fix for the whitespace problem in the XML file.
I'm not sure about the change to include `:` here. It's not really a Lua identifier, and it's not really a C identifier. It's more of a C++ identifier.
This looks like a leak.
import "github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node/client/stats/dto"
Is this change needed?
Is this still necessary?
> thisArg = thisArg || window; this is a common pattern, but I think it's better to use a variable name that's more specific, e.g. `defaultArg`.
nit: I'd prefer if we didn't use the `final` keyword here.
index column names [%s]
I don't think we should do this. It is the user's responsibility to make sure that the CRDs are installed.
Why is this needed?
I think we can remove `is not None` here.
This line is not needed.
I don't think you need to pass `addToStaticNodes` here.
This should be nullable
> LayoutEntry [](start = 11, length = 12) nit: LayoutEntry is not very descriptive. Maybe LayoutInfo or LayoutElement?
Is this the same problem as the one you had with the Linux driver?
UTF-8 with no BOM
I think we should also support a `num_stages` argument, and if it's not specified, then it should be `num_stages=0`.
I think this description should be in the doc.
@tmalaska I've updated the docs accordingly.
Line is too long. [87/80]
I'm not sure about this name. I would call it "none" as well.

I think we should keep the old code here. The Subscribe and Publish permissions are different.
If you want to use `[]string` as a slice of strings, you need to use `[]string` as the type of the slice.
Nit: This file has the same problem as `bazel/internal/extutil.go`
If you're sure that this is the only case, you can simplify it to `if re.fullmatch(r'[A-Z]:[^\\]', path, re.IGNORECASE):`
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
IConnectionHeartbeatTickFeature.OnHeartbeat(DateTimeOffset, object) [unsafe]
Please add an empty line after static imports.
I don't think this is necessary, as you are using the `onnx_export` decorator on the `forward` method.
This is an unrelated change.
why do we need to get the hash from the block here?
getDataverseException Compound: null
This is wrong. `scan` is always less than `count`.
I don't think this change is related to the rest of the PR.
I'm not sure about this change. If we don't shrink the list here, the list is empty in the `send_rtp` function. This means that the `endpoint.unicastLocatorList` will be set to a default value, which is the empty list. But if we
I don't think we should be doing this. This will set the local IP address on the task itself. The task is just a reference to the container. The container itself should be setting the local IP address.
Metrics/LineLength: Line is too long. [132/120]
I'm not sure why this was excluded before.
Is there a reason why we're doing this? I think we should keep the `path_parts` and `fn` variables around for consistency.
Shouldn't this be `language=java,grpc=true`?
from kinto import __version__ import time strftime
This is wrong. The label callback function is only set once.
@derekgreene Is this intentional? I don't see where the write concern is set in the constructor
`typeof(data) === 'string'` should be `typeof data === 'string'`
I'm not sure if this is a good idea. It's very likely that this will break things, as we're changing the way the module works.
Please add a description to the param
multiSend [JSON_DATA]
This is a non-const reference, so we can't just replace the entire map with a new one.
@alalazo can you please add the 2020 copyright to the header of this file?
I'm not sure if this is the right way to do this. I don't think we should hardcode the forbidden hosts here.

@rhatdan @dmitsh @pgavlin @mmaxim This is the only change to the core code, but it's a big one. It's not possible to replace the `phOpen` and `phClose` characters in the middle of a string, so we have to make sure
SubnetGatewayIPV4Address is the address to the subnet gateway for the eni
I'm not sure about this change. I think we should keep the field as `protected final` to avoid accidentally changing it in derived classes.
nit: could we use `require.NoError` here too?
This is the same thing as the `caddy.LogDestination` variable below.
I think you need to add the import.
Please update the message body for this case.
@julienlancelot I'm not sure this is a good idea. I'm afraid that we'll have to do the same for the rest of the apps.
I'm curious what was the reason for this change?

Line is too long. [122/80]
Shouldn't this be a pointer to a string instead of a string?
Shouldn't this be in the server config?
@jridgewell - this is a change I had to make to get it working.
using namespace std; #include "Util/LuaUtil.h"
Remove extra empty line.
I think the name is a bit misleading, as it will also drop encap traffic from the control plane. Perhaps DropWorkloadEncapsulationPacketsFromControlPlane would be more accurate.
Is this change required?
This method is now deprecated.
This is a temp file path. It should be removed after the test.
This is not a command.
I'm not sure this is the right fix. If you are going to squash a branch, you want the new branch to be the one with the latest commit.
"using parent snapshot " -> "using parent snapshot %v"
This is the main change in this PR. I think we should change the project name to app name to be consistent with the app manager.
Can we move this into a constant?
enode://b5948a2d3e9d486c4d75bf32713221c2bd6cf86463302339299bd227dc2e276cd5a
this is a little bit confusing, if you set this to false, the user is not privileged, but if you set it to true, the user is privileged?
I'm not sure this is the right fix. If the base table is not deleted, then the new table will be empty and there is no need to add the previous metadata.
This should be removed. The `queryObject` is not being used anymore.
The import of the LoggerFactory is not necessary.
Is there a way to get the node name from the driverName?
This is not a very descriptive id. It should be something like "proposals-completed-past-pr"
Is this the only way to get the outfit by lookType?
This should be CALI_DEBUG2, or even CALI_DEBUG3.
Patch method added to the collection.
@nishant-sharma I think you can't use `fStruct` here. `fStruct` is a `LogicalType` and `sStruct` is a `RowType`. You can't cast `LogicalType` to `RowType`.
I'm not sure about this one. I'm not sure if we should call it visitor or user loyalty.
This should be `IsInt` or `IsIntSet` or something like that.
Unused block argument - key. If it's an object method, use _ or _key as an argument name to indicate that it won't be used.
bigquery "github.com/bonitoo-io/go-sql-bigquery"
this is a bit dangerous, you are modifying the json string before you parse it. I would do it in the init method.
I think this is the only change necessary for the Tizen 4.0 support.
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundClassBody: Extra empty line detected at class body end.
I think we should use the same format as `getDownloadSize` for consistency.
no longer needed.
This is a little weird, because it is the same as the function in `index.js`. I'm not sure why we have this function in this file.
This doesn't look like it's being used anywhere.
I think this test is still needed.
I think you can remove this empty line.
I'm not sure about the name. I think it should be icmpPkt_with_type_code.
@marek-zb : This is the same as Weh_x, but for 32 bit. It is needed to support 32 bit VEX.
Doesn't work as expected because some services share IP address with each other and with location oracle which is supposed to be routed through VPN tunnel.
Nit: I think we can just pass `True` as the default value for this.
is this change necessary?
This is not a coalesce, it's a case when. The value will be the first result or the default value.
I'm not sure if we should do this. I don't think we should set the container name if it's nil. I think it's better to have the user set it.
Shouldn't this be `static function (ContainerConfigurator $containerConfigurator): void { return $containerConfigurator->services(); }` ?
@jridgewell @annando I don't think this change is necessary.
This seems like it could be moved into the `sendEventOrIgnore` function.
Redundant assignment to variable - @offering = @product.
why do we need this?
Route /my-accounts is missing a default url option.
I don't think this change is related to this PR
nit: please add a docstring for these exceptions
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
This action is not necessary anymore, since the action hook is already in the SettingsManager class.
Please remove this.
`string` is a bad type for a file name, since it is not guaranteed to be a file name. It can be a directory name, a path or anything else.
This is a breaking change. The type will be serialized as "IResource" instead of "Microsoft.Rest.Azure.IResource". I think we should either leave it as is or change the serializer to use the new type.
Failed to acquire locks from metastore because 'HIVE_LOCKS' doesn't exist, this probably happened when using embedded metastore or doesn't create transactional meta table. Please reconfigure and start the metastore.
I think this should be ===

Use next to skip iteration.
nit: maybe `std::vector<const FieldDef* const>` ?

@joshua-brown can you check this out? I'm not sure if this is correct.
I'm not sure if we should rename the test classes.
Is the description still used?
I would like to have this message with the exception message.
This is not a good change. This will add a new interceptor each time we create a new Inbound. I think the right thing to do is to add the interceptor to the existing interceptors list.
This is a bit confusing, since we already have a `NewWorkflowType` enum. Maybe just call this `NewWorkflowTypeUnspecified`?
Why do we need this interface?
This import is unused.
I think this is a bug fix, not a perf improvement.
"Овие акредитиви не се совпаѓаат со нашите записи." => "These credentials do not match our records."
I think it's better to add a "should not be false" to the end of the sentence.
This is a bit confusing, but I think it's a good idea to keep the existing code.
I think it would be better to pass the relation directly to the method instead of hardcoding it.
should this be "failed to allocate enough memory" ?
@gianm @nvazquez @michael-hobbs Is this the right way to do it?
Is there a reason we're not passing in the `machine.Machine.Spec.Versions.Kubelet` as the default image version?
nit: remove the toString()
Configuration key indicating the optional name of the custom header to take into account for the ip address. Default is value is null (do not override).
>An ISpanContext with default values. Can be used as the value for Parent in Tracer.StartActive(string, SpanCreationSettings) to specify that the new span should not inherit the currently active scope as its parent.
I don't think this is a valid change.
@erwinmombay @samsondavies Can you please review this change?
I think you should call this method before calling caffe_memcpy().
I think you're missing a space after the `if`.
I'm not sure I understand this change. It looks like it's trying to set up a dataresidency.StoreSingleton, but then not actually using it?
Filter signals and trigger TabbedBrowser signals if needed.
I think we can keep the "Paint" spelling here.
Unused block argument - digest.
`URL parameters to be passed to the query.`
plugins.delete(:validate_resolve_reference)
This regex is a bit more complex than the others, but I think it will work. The first group is the subpackage name, the second group is the package name, and the third group is the version.
@adambkaplan do you know why we have a `ProbabilitySampler` here? I think it's a leftover from a previous PR?
The method get() in the type Metric is not applicable for the arguments (Object[])
Shouldn't this be `unexpected status %d`?
I think this is a bit misleading. The error message should say something like "invalid query parameter 'foo' in URL %q".
Why is this not implemented?
Value of nbits is Negative
Will need to figure out how javascript will affect the testing.
I think it's more clear to have this as a function, since the return value is the string.
I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it. Shouldn't this be the default value?
I don't think this is needed. If you want to be sure that it's not set, just use `self._format is None`
This will be the case for all shortcuts. It would be better to have a specific method for it.
I think this needs to be removed, since it is no longer used.
Unnecessary spacing detected.
Line is too long. [117/80]
Why is this not `schema` here?
I would have done it with a try/except. It is not a big deal but it would have been more explicit.

I'm not sure about the name of this enum value. It is not clear to me what this means.
Style/RedundantSelf: Redundant self detected.

This variable is never used.
I'm not sure about this change. If `getScriptEnv()->getThingByUID(getNumber<uint32_t>(L, -1))` returns `nullptr`, the `!=` will return `false` and the `pushBoolean(L, false)` will return `0`,
I think we should call this num_built_blocks_count() to match the other stats functions.

I don't think this should be imported from molecule, it should be imported from the utilities module.

I think this is a bit too much, we should only need to know if we're using tqdm or not. We should also use a logger, so that we can get some metrics about how long it took to do something.

I'm not sure about this change. It seems like it might make it easier to understand the flow of the code, but it might also be more confusing. I think it's a bit of a trade-off.

Is this needed? I don't see it being used.
This one is a bit confusing to me. I think the intent was to add the `T` to the `findElements` method, but the `T` is actually the `By` argument, so the type of the return value should be `List<By>`.

This is a breaking change. It's not possible to have a Timescale connection without a URI. If you don't have a URI, you shouldn't have a Timescale connection.
I think it would be better to use the same error type as the `errTLFJournalDisabled` error here. That way it's clear what error is being returned.

"recreating AlertManager StatefulSet because the update operation wasn't possible" -> "recreating AlertManager StatefulSet because the update was forbidden"
This is a bit of a nit, but I'd prefer the check to be on `total_files` and `total_bytes` being in the dict. I'm not sure what the intention is, but it seems like the intention is to allow for a dict to be passed in with other keys.
This doesn't need to be in the API. It's a local setting that is used only for testing.
You can't add a new argument to the class, you have to add it to the constructor.
This is a regression. I don't know why this is needed.
I don't think we need the `proxyPort` parameter.
I think we should also set the default to -1 for the parallel levels.
This is a bit of a weird change. The previous code was more explicit about what was going on. The new code might not be obvious.

The `body` argument is a list, so `append` should be used.
`errImageForbidden` should be moved to the `errors` package
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
`reserve` is a non-const function, so it's not clear to me why this is not constexpr.
I think this should be `Original` and `Temp` (the same as `os/stat`).
*CmpCommon::diags() << DgSqlCode(-4322) << DgTableName(naTable->getTableName().getQualifiedNameAsAnsiString()); bindWA->setErrStatus(); return NULL;
I think we need to do this in the test for bokeh as well.
> sendAllControls(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE); [](start = 16, length = 44) I think this can be simplified to sendAllControls(FALSE, TRUE)
this is a no-op if the library is empty. I don't think this is a problem, but thought I'd mention it
import order should be gcpduckv1alpha1, gcppubsubv1alpha1, knative.dev/pkg/apis/duck/v1
Line is too long. [83/80]
Unused import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
This was removed because it was redundant with the check below.
I think this should be "given multisig preimage hashes to neither Sender nor AuthAddr"
Can you explain why we need to set sniff to false here?
Nit: You could just use `[]` here.
Do not use the new Ruby 1.9 hash syntax.
Please remove empty line.
I think we can remove this method.
I think this is the wrong way around. You want to find the block that's in the middle of the range.
I don't think we need to add this to the command line. If the config is null, we can assume that the user wants proto annotations.
I think this should be a race condition.
/se/grid/newsessionqueue -> /se/grid/newsessionqueue
Align the elements of a hash literal if they span more than one line.
Should this be in a finally block?
I would use `namespace Ergonode\Multimedia\Infrastructure\Service;`
I don't think this is a good change, this is a public API, and the user can specify the span id. If we are going to change it, then I think we should add a new constructor that sets the span id to the trace id.
This is a no-op, right?
I'm not sure we should do this here. It's possible we're still waiting on prefetches from the previous fetch. If we cancel those, we may not be able to fetch the blocks.
Please remove this line.
this is not needed anymore?
I don't understand why this is needed.
I think this is a bit confusing, what does it actually mean?
This doesn't seem to be related to this PR.

The Vault AppRole is used to authenticate against the Vault service. The AppRole is a special type of role that is used to access the Vault API. The AppRole can be used to perform actions such as creating and reading secrets. The AppRole is a JSON Web Token (JWT)
I'm not sure if we should be logging here. The exporting of data should be handled in a separate thread and we shouldn't be waiting for the data to be exported. I'm not sure if this is the case.
I'm not sure if we want to return here or just let the loop continue. I think it's better to continue, since we can't know what will happen after the ProduceEnd is called.
The fixture was unused, so I removed it.
Is this a typo?
SerializationException extends SerializerException
This is not the correct translation, as it's a word for word translation. The word "attached" is a noun and "ligado" is an adjective.
Please add a doc to this method.
It seems to me that the afterClickOn should be called after the submit.
`ipAddresses` is a list of IP addresses that should be included as part of the Order validation process. This field must match the corresponding field on the DER encoded CSR.

@garyrussell this is not related to your bugfix, but I think it is a good idea to remove the two final fields from this class and make them private, so they can be changed without having to do a new class.

I would suggest a name like "no_replace_variables_in_template" to be consistent with the other flags.

This is going to cause problems if the keyboard grab is not on the same seat as the view.
why not make it a const and use that instead of checking if empty?
This change is unrelated to the other changes in this PR.
Why is this here?
I don't think this should be a constant. It should be configurable.
Your AWS config is missing Region information, ECSTask requires a working config.
I would rename this to `createFlexibleConfigWithAccountPermissioningDisabledShouldReturnEmpty`
Please use the `addGameTask` method.
This is the only change that seems necessary to me.
I think we should not expose this to the user. If the user wants to set it, we should let the user set it in the constructor.

@nickytonline I'm seeing this error in Chrome 86.0.4424.110. It looks like the text was truncated in Chrome 86, but not in Firefox 82 or Safari 14.0.
Use date file was shared instead of modified date. Note that, as with "--drive-use-created-date", this flag may have unexpected consequences when uploading/downloading files. If both this flag and "--drive-use-created-date" are set, the created date is used.

Keychains that shouldn't be shown in the keyhint dialog
I think we can remove the import from the `type` statement.
I'm a little confused by this change. The code below is not called until we have found a file in the dag, so this change is not needed.

I'm not sure about this, I think we should be able to do it with the current API, but I'm not sure. I'll try to investigate more.

I'm not sure if this should be an option or a default value. If you are adding a bookmark for the first time, it's probably better to raise an error than to remove it.
This is a change in behavior. It is not clear to me why this is a change in behavior. I don't see a reason to remove SIGKILL from the list of signals that we are interested in.
Why do we need this check?
Is there a way to get this to be consistent with the other changes?
`keys.join('')` is a no-op, `keys` is an array of arrays, so `keys.join('')` is equivalent to `keys`
Nit: I would have done this assignment in the previous line.
I'm not sure about this, because it seems to me that we should not change the command.readPreference value, because it is the one that is stored in the MongoDB server, and we should not change it.
I'm not sure this should be here, I think this should be a part of the `spiffeid.TrustDomain` struct.
This will be retrying for 1 minute every time. I think this is probably a bit too long. I'd probably try to set a shorter interval here.
this should be a different test.
> SCOPE_EXIT { [](start = 25, length = 10) This is not necessary, as the destructor will cleanup the object.
Why is this change needed?
This will set SCAPY_ROOT_DIR to the current working directory of the test runner, which may not be the same as the current working directory of the test itself. It would be better to set it to the current working directory of the test.
This will disable the field on page load. If you want to keep it enabled, you need to add `disabled=false` to the `attr` function call.
hmmm, we need to be careful about circular dependencies between the element and the dimension classes.

This is a case of "sloppy equality" - it should be `===`
Why not use _networkConfig.ActivePeersMaxCount + _peerPool.StaticPeerCount.Count() asReadOnly()?
I think it would be better to have a field for the security group IDs, rather than a map of roles to rules. This way we can avoid having to duplicate the same security group rule in the security group rules map for each role.
Use 3 (not 4) capture groups for regex literals.
This doesn't seem to be right. If we have `content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=XXX`, then this will return 0, even though we have a multipart form. I think this should be `if content_type.startswith("multipart/form-data

I think this is the only place where we need to pass the context to the function, right?
this line should be before the line 1005

The removal of this line makes it so that we'll never see a `Registered` metric for this endpoint. I think we should still want to record that information.
@davidjumani hyperlink failed examples are now hyperlinked
nit: this is an anti-pattern. It's better to have a default value, and then do a `!getFalse()` if the value is not set.
Should this be `awsTagFlag` or `awsTagsFlag`?
"IP strings: IPv4: 10.0.0.1, IPv6: 2001:db8::1"

I think this should be `bool` and not `bool?`.
nit: can we use the visitor API to get the visitor here?
`isHydrating` is never set to `true` in this case. I think this can be removed.
This should be a `V(logf.DebugLevel)` as it is not critical information.
This is the only change in this file, so it's fine to leave it as is.
I'm not sure about this. The inversedBy property is used to tell the relation what entity to be removed from the relation when the entity is removed from the database. So if we set the inversedBy property here to payments, we will tell the relation to remove the transport when a payment

@mmaxim can you confirm this is the right way to fix this?
If we are not going to update the LifeTimeInQueue, then we should also remove the LifeTimeInQueue from the ProducerInvocationMonitor.
The new test is in `ctu_failure.py`.

Updating task: Task {status: Running, name: my-container-name, image: docker.io/library/my-image:latest, node: node-1, pod: pod-1, uid: 1234567890, startedAt: 2
I would use the full name of the protocols here.
Why is this necessary?
I would prefer to have these as `public static final` to make it easier to use in the tests.
I think this should be a private method
I don't understand the purpose of this. It seems like you're trying to make sure the heading isn't too long. But the paragraph is the content of the heading. So it's not possible for the heading to be too long.
@chrsmith this should be fixed by this change
trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, any.
This value must be between 0 and 19 (inclusive).
I think we should add a dependency on the context package.
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
This one looks wrong to me.
Why not "no_model1_train"?
Missing argument - password
I'm not sure if we want to make this change. This is a private property and we shouldn't have to specify the type here.
@mfojtik @smarterclayton This should be the same as `class` right?
This change is not necessary, as the exit() function is called in the end of the main function.
This is a breaking change.
Metrics/LineLength: Line is too long. [123/120]
I'm not sure we should be adding this to the interface. I think it's fine to have the type of the `Index` be `Index` but I don't think we should have it be an interface.
Reconciling internet gateways
This is a little confusing, and I'm not sure if it's correct. The problem is that we're trying to find implicit nodes, but then we're filtering them based on the presence of a certain attribute. This means that the implicit nodes that we find might not be implicit nodes anymore.
This looks like it could be a race condition. If the `isAvailable` check fails, but the URL still ends in a slash, we could be left in a state where the `XhrClient` is instantiated but not used.
Compute service account to be used by importer. When empty, the Compute Engine default service account is used.
I think we should also add a note that the checksum is computed using the content-encoding header.
this was just for the test to start the timer
This one is going to break a lot of things.
The file should be relative to the current working directory, not the upload directory.
I'd remove this.
I think it's better to call this "old_adj_size"
Why is this needed? I'm assuming this is to prevent the catchup service from trying to write the file while the Ledger is being updated. But if that's the case, why not just return false here and use the `IsWritingCatchpointFile` method in the catchup service
I'm not sure why this is needed.
This was not used.
Why not use `helper_wait_for_at_least_entries` here?
Is this field ever used?
I think we should have a test for this.
Do we need to add these two fields?
why is this removed?
This seems like a bug fix, not a performance improvement.

This is not correct. You can't append or prepend a tuple.

InternetGatewayID *string `json:"internetGatewayId"`
This should be reverted.
I think this message should be changed to: "Remote debugging server started successfully. Try pointing a Chromium-based browser to " + hostname
Can we call this `sharedPV` instead of `shared`?
Why is this necessary?
I think we should also have this change in the `dask.array.stack` docstring.
Unused import from selenium.types
This seems to be a very specific case. I would consider refactoring it to a separate method in ProtoPageStreamingTransformer.
@mmaxim @mmaxim-2 I was wondering if you would know why this error message is not accurate anymore?
#include <fmt/format.h> [33/33]
This is not the right fix. The real fix is to not allow the mirror to be set to nil.
To be honest, I'm not sure what the best way to handle this is. The current implementation uses a `using` statement, which is a bit weird, but it's a bit of a pain to dispose of the builder manually.
fboHead fboMutexLevel = 2 fboBlock fboMutexLevel = 3
"gocloud.dev/internal/secrets" should be removed.
why not just `d.receivedPeers[addr.ByteString()] = struct{}{}` ?
I don't think this is correct. I think the actor state should return an error.
Minor: this should be one line.
Status code is changed from internal to ok.
Shouldn't this be a static import?
@ruddell I don't know what's the best way to call this. "Senders" is the "From" addresses, but that's not a great name. Maybe "Recovery"?
ioctlUtil is not a go import
Nit: You can move this to a separate file and import it.
unbindEvents is not defined.
I think you can remove the if statement.
import android.graphics.Color; should be android.graphics.Color.RED
Why is this error logged?
I think this will be called every time the button is clicked, so you should move it into the `onClick` method
`keyFilePath` should be `keyFilePathPath` to match the other method
The port to run the server on 8080
This should be on a new line
Can we make this more robust? Say, if there is no sla options, then set the empty list.
> For pubsub.OpenTopic and pubsub.OpenSubscription, azurepubsub registers for the scheme "azuresb". > The default URL opener will use a Service Bus Connection String based on the environment variable "SERVICEBUS_CONNECTION_STRING". > To customize the URL
I'm not sure we should be changing this. The spec is testing against the response from the server.
I'm a little confused by this. What does `cursor.cursorState` contain?
no newline, please
Block has too many lines. [27/25]
Is this class public?
This should be `import App from './App.vue'`
I think it would be better to use `contains` instead of a `for` loop.

I don't think this is the right error here.
I think this is correct.

@smarterclayton I think this is the change you were looking for.
This is not needed, since the import is in the parent class.

I'm not sure this is a good idea. This is a breaking change and we have to ensure that the old code still works.
I'm not sure if this test should be here.
this is a bug fix. I am not sure if this will work in all cases.

This is a test project.
I'm not sure this is a great name. I'm not sure if I'd call this a "cleanup function" since it doesn't actually clean up anything.
`id.Id` is unused. Consider removing it.
I'm not sure about this change. The name parameter is supposed to be the module name, and 0 is not a valid module name. I'm pretty sure that the original code was right.
This is a bug fix, right?
approver, and the CertificateRequest is ready for signing. Denied indicates that a CertificateRequest has been denied by the approver, and the CertificateRequest will be never be signed.
I think it would be better to have this check in `MolOps::addHs`
I am really loving upcase. The most valuable part for me was how I was able to dissect the upcase app and see how it was built. Having the access to the repo and seeing how codes were structured was such a priceless lesson.
Nit: Can we call this `defaultSyncBlockCacheFractionBytes` and `defaultDiskBlockCacheFractionBytes` to make it more clear what this is?
I would recommend renaming this to `FINDINGS_FILENAME_SUFFIX` since we're not using it as a filename, but as a suffix for the filename.
ValidationException is not a real error. I don't think we should be using it in this file.
I think we can remove the log message, and just have the `inSync` flag.
Please add the leech chance to the end of the string, not at the beginning.
I don't think this is the right way to define this macro. I think it's better to have a function to do this, and use it in multiple places.
Use the new Ruby 1.9 hash syntax.
I think we should add a log message if the host is not set.

Why not `ErrCodeNotFound`?
Listing of namespace foo resulted in the following tables: [foo.foo_table, foo.foo_table_2]
This is a change to the code that was unrelated to the bug fix.
I don't think this is correct. OPSZ_CACHE_LINE is a 64-bit value, but you're setting the opnd_t to be 64 bytes long.
This should be `azure-parameter-grouping.json`
Can you use "statistics" instead of "stastics" ?
Style/StringLiterals: Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
Import order should be sorted.
This is going to be a bit confusing for someone reading this code. It looks like we're checking if the shape is used in a list or a map, but we're actually checking if the memberRef or valueRef is used in a list or a map.
DEPRECATED. The flag will be removed. If Cross-TU analysis is enabled and fails for some reason, try to re analyze the same translation unit without Cross-TU enabled.
Please move the MetricsConfig initialization to the constructor.

This is the same test.
this is not needed anymore
The output of the tests has changed a bit, I'm not sure why.
I think we can remove this line
I would use `consumerInterface` instead of `consumerIntf`
GetEx is like Get(addr, false), but also loads specific creatable
11 trailing blank lines detected.
Nit: Can we use `strings.TrimPrefix` here?
Is there a reason you're using `POSIX_C_SOURCE` instead of `POSIX_VERSION_CODE`?
This method is used to list all the workloads of a given application.
This is an empty list.

This is a private member of HPX, so I think it should be HPX::m_was_finalized.
Wrong value for TaskNetwork
>VK_DEBUG_REPORT_OBJECT_TYPE_UNKNOWN_EXT [](start = 16, length = 31) This is not an object type.
I think this is a little strange. Why not just use the value from FeatureGroupSizesInByte?
The `getVersion()` method is called twice in this class. It should be moved to the `RowReader` class.
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundClassBody: Extra empty line detected at class body end.
This can be done in a single readInt32T() call.
This is the change I don't like. I think it's better to add `response_headers` to `params` and let the caller decide what to do with it.
I don't think we should use finest for logging this.
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundClassBody: Extra empty line detected at class body end.
Line is too long. [82/80]
This will be null if there is an error and the SnackBarHandler is not initialized.
I think we should move this validation to `ParquetSchemaUtil.convert` method, it's a good place to validate schema.
I think this is a bad idea. I think it is a good idea to keep this as a bool. I think this will make it more difficult to understand the response, and the error will not be more useful than the bool.
`staticOnly` parameter should be renamed to `static`
I'd suggest to add a note about the default value of the parameter.
can we make this path `/settlements/payments` instead of `pay`?
I'm not sure if this is the correct fix. I don't think this is the problem, but it is a related bug. I think the problem is that the call to readToken is not called at all in the if statement. I think it should be called in the if statement, so that it
This import should be moved up to be with the other imports.

`actualNode` is now a `virtualNode`.
This should be an `array` of `array`s.
I'm not sure if this is a good change. It's possible that we want to make the error message more explicit.
I'm not sure this test will work. It is using a method that is not yet implemented in WebDriver.
I don't think we should change the name of the attribute. We should be consistent with the other attributes we are using in this file. I would suggest to change the name of the method and to keep the attribute name.
This is a very good example of how a generated method can be used.

`doi.username` and `doi.password` are set as system properties, but the code is not using them.

I don't think this method is useful, it's a shortcut to the current method.
This was just a temporary fix to get it to compile. I'm not sure why it's not working, but I'm not sure why it should be working either.
Is this really necessary? I think you can just do `_.isEqual(actual, expected)`
Do not use the new Ruby 1.9 hash syntax.
I'm not sure about this. It might be better to make this a static method in ElasticsearchSpanStore. This is the only call site, and it is a singleton.
I think you can remove this line.
I'm not sure about this change. It's possible that a call to `zwlr_screencopy_frame_v1_send_frame` might be pending on the screen copy server, but the frame has already been sent to the client. I think this is a problem.

This is a bit ugly but I think it's the best we can do until we can remove the `Thread.current` from the cache.
I don't think this is a good idea. The reason for using `string_types` is to avoid adding `str` to `typing.Type`. If we use `str` in `derived_from` we will have to add `str` to `typing.Type` which will

@smarterclayton should we also test the `ipam.service.type` case?
@rhatdan can you please confirm that this is the correct behavior? I'm wondering if we should also add a special case for `v.Type() == semantic.String` to avoid a `json.Unmarshal` error.
Unnecessary spacing detected.
Is it possible to have the `config` argument to this function as a pointer? That way you could just pass `nil` and have the default implementation.
I'm not sure about this change. I don't think we want to remove the audit for the `CreateFederatedBundle` RPC.
Configures isolated transaction batch writing. If supported by the database, then it will improve insert performance.
This is the same as the `readBlockProducersByHeightTests` below, so it's not necessary to have two tests for this.
"azkaban.logging.kafka.globalDisable"
The same as above. It seems that `reader.Value` is nullable, so we should use `??` here.
Redundant `attr_reader` detected.
I don't think we need the trailing newline.
{namespace}
I'm not sure about this name. It's not "in reverse chronological order" because you can't do it in Java. It's "in reverse chronological order" if you're sorting on the pubDate attribute.
The default constructor for `JavadocComment` takes a `String` argument. This is why it works.

If `country` is nil, `countryString` will be set to `"Unknown"` here, and then to the empty string below. Is this intended?
Is this still necessary?
Failed to download block 2. nil
I'm not sure what the `repoNode` allows. Can you add that here?
These methods are not used by the API.
The new default value for the lease timeout is 5 seconds, which is not very long. Is it really necessary to increase it to 5 seconds?
Can we add a docstring here?
Align the parameters of a method call if they span more than one line.
It is not a good idea to have two kinds of handling here. I suggest to add a new method to TiIndexColumn.getIndexColumn(tableInfo) to return the column that can be used in index scan.
strtolower() should be used here, too.
I think this should be moved to `onNewIntent` to be consistent with the other cases
nit: typo "retry" => "retry it"
This will never be true, because the default value is 0, so this will always be true.
@sureshanaparti This is not the only place where the key field is accessed. It is also accessed in `getProjection(Schema.Field keyField, Schema.Field valueField)`.
[debug] InitBalanceStr: 200000000
This import is not needed.
why do we need to set the username here?
I think this is safe to remove.
I'm not sure about this. I think the `addcslashes` should be applied before the `implode`, so that the `addcslashes` does not get applied twice.
This is not needed anymore.
Trailing whitespace detected.

This is the only place that uses the lock. Should we move the lock into the function?
Is this really needed?

I think we should use `formatTimeAgoText` instead of `formatTimeAgo` here.
I think this should be public.
Is this interface really needed?
I think this should be called "inContainer" or "inPodContainer" to be more specific.
Why is this change needed?
I think this is the wrong name. I think this should be called `ForceTraceWriteline` and `RawWrite` should be a property that does what it did before.
ImportError: No module named flask
@mjkkirschner I added the assembly reference to `Instrumentation.Http` as it is used by the `HttpClient` test. I'm not sure if it's required for the other tests as well, but I didn't want to make it dependent on the test framework.
`window.c2.activityCardController.update` is called before `window.c2.activityCardController.showActivity`
Shouldn't this be a default value?
The import should be on the same line as the first usage.
This test should fail, I think.
"data reader expects data with m_num_labels labels, but data sample data_id has a label of label"
This was causing the test to fail.
This is not really needed, since it is a const.
param 0 must be of type string
> instance that will be used at runtime to transmit telemetry over HTTP.
I think we should add a `required_subject` to the `TEST_TOPIC_NAME` as well.
I'm wondering if we should default to the same value as `DataDir` (i.e. `/data/`)? I'm also wondering if we should add this to the `DefaultSpec` struct as well?
I think we should be consistent here and either use `this.provider` or `this.authProvider` everywhere, and I think `this.authProvider` is the right one.
Do not use nested blocks.
Ignoring container 2203594728807840000 with --net=host
This should be a separate method, and also I'd prefer it to be named `StopProcesses`.
Is this the right type? I think this is a channel of struct{}s
I think this is an unnecessary change.
this is not needed, it's already in the for loop
Why not just use `[][]byte` directly?
I'm surprised we didn't have a bug before with this. I would have expected the copy to happen after the flow is set.
This line should be removed.
I'm a bit concerned that this may cause a problem with the IPSet, since we're not adding the IPs in the same order as we receive them.
I think we should be able to get rid of this middleware, and instead use `middleware.RepoRef()`
Is this example still valid?
Shouldn't the change be reverted?
Is this intentional?
I think this should be removed from the `Sonata\MediaBundle\Command\AddMedia` class as well
Unused import org.mozilla.vrbrowser.ui.widgets.WidgetPlacement;
This one's a bit more tricky, since it's an overload, and we don't want to break the current API, but it's not a big deal, since the current API doesn't actually work, since the return type isn't known until the end of the method.
I think the change in this line is not necessary.
why the underscore?
Please revert this change.
import "os"
Hello there! We're happy to have you here. We hope you'll find this community helpful and inspiring. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you! Best,
I don't think this is the right fix. It should be: CONFIG_FILE = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'config/kinto.ini')
I think this is the wrong way around. It should be: unless exception_class_name =~ /RSpec/ lines[1] = colorizer.wrap(exception_class_name, :failure) + ":" end
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
@nvazquez I'm curious about this method. I don't see any usage of it in the codebase. I think we can just remove it.
Increase verbosity
Is this really needed? I don't think so.
`offset` is a `uint64` type.
I think this is a good idea. But I think you need to make the new File object a local variable so that it can be closed properly.
Why is this removed?
I'm not sure why this was here, but I removed it as it is no longer needed.
I'm not sure if we want to have the `PutTipSetAndState` method. It seems like it could be a breaking change to the API. We might want to have a method that accepts a `chain.TipSetAndState` and just sets the head.
I'm not sure why this is necessary, but it is.
This is the problem. The config is not an array, but a stdClass.
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.

I think it's better to use `assert.NotNil(t, cd, "missing clusterdeployment")`
This change is not needed.
F401 Unused import 'fixit_file'
Should we export this as a package variable instead?
The first part of the regexp seems to be wrong, since it allows a semicolon to be included.
This import should be in the right package.
IsOnMainThread is unused.
Can you update the docstring to include the new direction?

@mhoemmen - what do you think about the following: - instead of opening a file for each iteration, we open the file at the beginning of the training and then just append to it - we also could add a line with the current iteration number, so we can see when we are at the end of
Parallel.For(0, 10, i => { Console.WriteLine("Iteration {0}", i); });
Please add a docstring.

I'm not sure I like this, but I don't know of a better way to avoid this from showing up in the logs.
@pypa/pants: I'm not sure what's going on here. I don't think this should be pragma: no cover.
Can we use the constant from the other class?
Why do we need this?
I think it's a good idea to cache the tarball, but this should be done in `add_tarball`
I'm not sure if we should add the 'history' here. I don't think we have any write operation for history, so I'm not sure if we should add it here.
Please remove this empty line.
Unused import.
Why not use the `http.ParseIPN` here?
router-expose is a very good name for this.
I don't think this is a valid change. I don't think we should be changing the field names in the generated specs.
go:build go1.15 && integration
I think it's better to have these as `c.srv.logging.debug` and `c.srv.logging.trace` instead of `c.srv.logging.debug` and `c.srv.logging.trace`.
I think we can just set the page source to 0 and not use the start row position at all.
nit: could you move these to alphabetical order?
@david-watts @chriswatts2015 this is a good example of the "log" that I was talking about.
Is this change correct?
@pabloem I think this should be `List[str]` as well.
MetricRegistry must not be null !!!
Grouping? Is that a word?
This doesn't seem right to me. If the image format is not compatible with the view format, then the image should not be used in a multisampled view.
This change seems unrelated.

I think this is the wrong way around. The code should be `const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');`
This should be a `null` check.

I think this test is incorrect, since it is not testing the validity of the tile url, but the validity of the TileParameters object. The URL should be invalid, but the TileParameters object should be valid.

I don't understand why this was changed.
This is too fine grained, but the previous log level is not very helpful. I would suggest something like: Detected dialect: %s. If the log level is set to debug, then the result is also logged.
Can you add a note that this flag is used by kubelet to skip setting device permissions on pods?
I'm not sure this is a hack. This is a normal function call that should be done in the constructor of the logger.
Shouldn't the same be done for `installExtension`?
This is a bug fix. This code is executed before the `doInBackground` method, so `arrayList` is always `null`.
this should be 37 now
This method should be called from the scheduler itself, not the controller.
This message should be changed too.
I think this is a typo, right?
I think this should be `hydrated-builds` to be consistent with `hydrated-packages`.
We'll need to remove this as well.
Is this going to break anything?
Import com.salesforce.androidsdk.smartsync.target.ParentChildrenSyncTargetHelper.RelationshipType cannot be resolved
The comma should be removed from the list.
The indentation is off.
Line is too long. [82/80]
"ALTER TABLE" is not enclosed in parentheses
This should be in the constants package, and it should be named `TLFJournalPauseType`.
This is a very good idea.
`readPreference.mode` should be removed from the object, and the code should be changed to `if (typeof readPreference.mode === 'string')`
I think we can remove this line, as we don't use any other extensions.
This is a struct. Why is it internal?
this is not correct. you need to set it in the options.
We are still not handling the case where the cleanup is failed.
@pabloem I'm not sure if it's worth it, but I decided to add the `@Public` annotation to this method since it's the only one that uses `sql` and it's not clear if this method should be public or not.
@xuehui1991 I am wondering why you need to modify the model?
This method should be renamed to `GetMetrics`.
Token expiration is set to 90 days by default.
I think we can use the blockchain module directly here, no need to define a new interface.
The exception class should be in the `Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception` namespace.
I'm not sure about this, but I think it's ok.
This doesn't do anything, right?
ip6 = iter(ip6).next()
> OnEnd [](start = 38, length = 11) Why do we need to add this?
I would suggest to use a more descriptive name here. What does "pref" mean?
This should be a `getter` method
@brycemay - can you double check this? I'm not sure I like this. If we change this code, we should make sure we update the old value as well.
This is a no-op since the uint32 will be converted to a byte when written.
Do this in the main goroutine since it isn't goroutine safe, and do this after wg.Wait() since we only know it's set after the goroutine exits.
Shouldn't this be `self.numberOfCells()`?
I think this should be set before the call to WriteMessageAsync, so that it's always the same value.
I think it would be better to return a `pd.MultiIndex` here. It would be more clear that it's a mapping between column names and types.
I'd like to avoid this if statement and use a switch statement.
@Pearl1594 please move this method to `HistoryRemovalTimeProvider`
Is this a tab or a space?
If we're logging at V(4) here, I'd like to see a corresponding change to the logging level for the `klog.V(4).Infof` statement in the `else` branch.
Nit: This method is not very descriptive. Maybe something like `hasResourceNameParameter` or `hasResourceNameFlattening` or `hasResourceNameFlatteningConfig` or `hasResourceNameFlatteningConfigs` ?
This is not correct. It's a function declaration, not a method.
successfully connected to peer (inbound) 127.0.0.1:10001
Is this still a problem?
@benjyw I'm not sure this is the best way to do this. It seems like it would be better to check the function's qualifier directly.
Should we add `api.SpecClusterName` to this list?
Please remove the additional `enableTelemetry` calls.
This is the same as the above, except that it's in Python.
This method was renamed because it no longer returns a `Schema`. It returns a `ProjectedSchema` now.
I don't think this is the right fix. I think we need to fix the `add_option` function itself.
This class is only used by the dashboard widget. We could just remove it from the dashboard.
I think NULL is the same as 0 here.
I don't think this should be removed. It's needed for the `volumes` section in the output.

I'm not sure if this is correct. It seems like it would break the code in other files that import this file. But it might be the right thing to do.
!clrstack -i is unsupported on this target. The ICorDebug interface cannot be constructed.
Is this change correct?
this one is not necessary.

I think we should make this conditional on the `if method == 'PUT'` check above. If the request is a PUT, then it is definitely an S3 request.
I'm not sure about this one. If it's used to describe the hourglass, then I think it's more like "timeout" or "time-out".
Nit: I would prefer to keep the type as `{ [name: string]: string }` as it is more explicit.

This is not a good change. We should not change the semantics of the remote cache. The cache should not have any knowledge of the remote build verification.
@liggitt I don't think we need to pass in the OVSBridge here. I'm not sure why it was necessary before.
I don't think we need to add this new code here. If the user does not set the `if_not_exists` flag, it means the index does not exist. So it is the same as the old code.
I think this is a bug fix.
I don't think this is a good change, the sentence should be in lowercase.
`content-type` is already defined in `options.headers`
I think we should remove this import and the call to `mock_apigateway`
No newline after 'import'
import "testing"
I think this is fine to do here, but if we do want to make this configurable, I think it would be better to do it in the SalesforceSDKManager class, so that we don't have to change it in every app that uses it.
Nit: I think this should be called `user-agents` to match the other `user-*` modules.
I don't think we should remove the delattr here. If we remove the delattr, the user's code will be broken.
RestoreFiles: removed 100 files that finished uploading
Your password contains leading/trailing whitespace - in previous versions of rclone this was stripped
The prePersistEntity is deprecated since EasyAdmin 1.x and will be removed in 2.0 version. Use persistEntity instead
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but it is how I do it.
tisoftware -> This is software
Please move this line above the `LibLog.Log(_scopeManager, LogLevel.Trace, "LibLogCorrelationIdentifierScopeSubscriber.ctor");` call.
@Junmei-Yang This is the main change in this PR. I am removing the `compare_dataset` method from the `Contours` class.
>The Namespace of this Service. I would write it as >The namespace of this Service.
Line is too long. [123/80]
@njhill is this intentional? I think the code would be more readable if you changed it to: `return back.indexOf(Character.valueOf(element), from);`
This should be "spb".
I don't see the point of the `Descriptors3D` here, since you don't use it in the code.
I think you need to add the openbsd build tag to this file, otherwise it won't build.
Nit: I'd like to see this as a warning message rather than an error, as it's not fatal.
`GetMethod` returns null if it's not found, so the `?` operator is unnecessary here.
Use 0-length array creation syntax.
I think this is a bug fix.
I don't think this is right. This will change the behavior of the inventory file for all playbooks.
This is not used anywhere.
prob is not used?
Is this file needed?
Use 2 (not 1) spaces for indentation in a hash, relative to the start of the line where the left curly brace is.
SingleArchiveFileRollsCorrectly
Unused import TestJsonFacets;
NIT: remove empty line
Is this check needed? If the short name is "s2" then we should never reach here, right?
This is the only thing that really needed changing.
I think we can remove the `wasDeleted` variable, as it is not used.
Nit: I think this should be in alphabetical order.
This is not required. You can directly set the dialog result in the dialog form's constructor.
This is not a good idea. I think the only reason this was added was to avoid having to create a new context and cancel it.
The implementation must be Serializable because instances will be serialized to tasks.
@smarterclayton - this is the change that I'm thinking of. I'm not sure if we need to pass the `ctx` and `dockerClient` here. The `agent.ctx` and `agent.dockerClient` are used in `ecsAgent.run()` and
The directory is not required for images that do not contain RPM.
Can you move this to a separate file, like the others?
I think we should just use `SIGUSR2` in the function name.

current_buckets = 1343899862834593409 current_mode_min_count = 1343899862834593409
I think this will cause a segfault if the sizes are not equal.
hi
this is the only place where we have a ZMSImpl, I think we should be able to remove the ZMSImplFactory.
System.String Os.Locale { get; set; }
TableColumn.physical("id", DataTypes.BIGINT())
@marek-laskowski - I'm curious if you think this change is a good idea.
@soralee @alexandre-pessin I'm not sure if we should add a new error message for this case. What do you think?
I don't think this change is correct.
@bvaradar is it possible to have null index and column count?
I think this will throw a NRE if the initializer is null.
This file is missing a doctest.
`app.UseKestrelHttps(new HttpsConnectionFilterOptions { ServerCertificate = cert});`
forseti-security is not a valid name for a logger, but this is a valid name for a service. You can use the service name here, which is forseti-security-service.
why not just `BlockHeaderByHeight`?
This is the only place where the `submit` button is displayed.
Is this an error? If not, maybe we should add a message to the log instead.
This is wrong, we need to use the user-specified tmp directory.
I don't think we need to wrap the error here.
I think we should remove this file and just import the site from the index.html.
nit: unused import
The field field
Nit: I'd put the import groups in alphabetical order.
I'm not sure if this is correct, I'm not familiar with this flag.
`ariaRoles` should be `ariaAttributes`

I think we should be able to do this in one line of code.
@njhill I think this is a good idea.
I'm not sure if this is a good idea. It would be better to have the command in the log as a string, so it can be easily searched. I think it would be better to have a separate log for the output, and to have a log message for the command.
import order is wrong
I would say "peers that are not already in the skipPeers list".
Is this going to be an issue for the `limit` type? I.e. we're now returning a float64 and not an int64?
import iec104, iec104_fields, iec104_information_elements, iec104_information_objects  # noqa: F401
is this test failing?
Nit: I think the correct spelling is "received".
You cannot delete any item. You should modify the existing.
This should be `self.headers.get("content-type")`
serverLacksFeature is not used.
Nit: Maybe we could add a TODO here to add this to the `ClientSessionState` type?
Is this still valid if `repeatEpisode` is false?
error process undefined

I don't think you need to check for a directory here, as that would never be a special file. You could probably just do `if os.path.exists(self._filename):`
>Initialize a new role using a local *cookiecutter* template. Thisallows the customization of a role while still using the defaultgenerated molecule folder. This is similar to anansible-galaxy init skeleton. Please refer to the init scenario command in order to customise the default

Please remove this line, it's not needed and will cause problems.
I'm not sure if this is a typo or not, but I think it's "Module of statistical data structures and functions used in learning algorithms and for analysis of HTM network inputs and outputs."
This change is not related to the bug fix, but I noticed that the IsHandleCreated property is always set to true when GraphSummary is created. I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do, since the property is only used to check if the handle is created or not. What do you think
Should we make this `optional` and add a default value?
I'm not sure why this file is changed.
I don't understand why this change is necessary.
I think this is a bug in the tests, not in the code.
@chrsmith I think this was changed by accident.
I'm not sure this is the best way to handle this, but I didn't want to change it in this PR. I think we need to think about how to deal with this. It seems like we're using the same "candidate_value_map" name for the global and the
I'm not sure if we should have a dependency on util.py in this file. We should be able to import it from the same directory.
machineset %v has unexpected annotations: expected: [{"key":"foo","value":"bar"}]\nactual: [{"key":"foo","value":"baz"}]
int is not a valid type for the argument to ReadPassword. Did you mean to use int32?
I think this should be `breakpoint=attrs.get("breakpoint", "")` so that it doesn't break if the attribute isn't there.
I don't think this is necessary. It looks like this function is called in a couple places where it's not necessary.
@smarterclayton I don't see this being used in the PR, is it still required?
I think you can use `props[key] = props[key].toLowerCase()`
I think this is the only place that attachStdin is used.
I'm not sure if this is the right way to check for an attribute. Can you check if `virtualNode.attr('alt')` is a string?
I don't think we need this header.
I'm not sure about this, as this will always be `ad.Source` if `ad.DeviceName` is empty, and we don't have any way to set the device name to the disk name.
I think it would be better to move this to the static initializer block in WebDriverException, rather than to move it to the constructor of By
This is the same as before, except that it's a bit more explicit about the error condition.
The project id that is hosting the network resources.
@AaronRobinson I'm not sure why you changed this. The old code was fine.
If you want to be fancy you can add a new tab with `background=True` and then change the background color of the tab in `on_load`.
I think it's better to call it `NotifyNewVisibilityTasksForFailoverVersion` or something like that.
scale_factor must be > 0
A valid range?
Use 2 (not 1) spaces for indentation in a hash parameter start.
This should be in alphabetical order.
The same thing here. It's a bit weird to put `weight` before `label`.
The serialVersionUID is set to 1L by default.

@saghul - do you know why this was a GET request before?
This method is used in both this class and `OrcTypeReader`, so I made it public to be able to access it from both.
For testing purposes.
This file is unused
`Duplicate user "foo" detected`
Please use the ternary operator.
I think you can remove the `tautomers` here and just use `res` directly
This is a breaking change. I'm not sure why it's not a breaking change. I'll fix it.
@benzonico - I think the previous sentence was clearer, what do you think?
Trailing whitespace detected.
@pgavlin, I'm not sure this is correct. The default umask is 0077, and it seems like it should be 0027.
Why is this needed?
Why is this a change?
`wp_json_encode` is used to convert an array into a JSON string.
I don't think this is right.
'mean PAAHead does not support test-time augmentation'
I think we should have a default value for `noteIds` here. `null` and `undefined` are not the same thing.
nit: "Values" or "VectorValues" (or something like that) is a better name for this type.
This is a private method. Why do you want to expose it to the outside?
I think this is a bug fix.
I don't think this is a good idea. If the host is a loopback IP, then it is a loopback IP. If it is not a loopback IP, then it is not a loopback IP. I think it is better to keep the code as it was before.
This file should be named `base.jsx` to match the other examples.
@unittest.skip
I'm not sure about this, it seems to be a bit weird to me.
Redundant `or`. Parentheses recommended.
I think this function should be named `compareAndSwapBound`.
@smarterclayton I am not sure if this is a bug or a feature. If it is a bug, I think it should be fixed.
[Reaction, Bug]
import "github.com/beat-tools/beat/beat/beat"
This should be `project.getBuildDir().getAbsolutePath()` as it is a path that belongs to the project.
I don't think this is necessary, the v2 import is already in the klogr import.
This method should be named `getName()`
I would suggest changing this to "the AWS SDK for Ruby v3."
I think it would be better to call this `AddonsExtraParamsOverride` to indicate that it is an override.
@chamikaramjol I think we should use `get_defaults` from `ast.analysis.analysis` instead of writing this code.
I'm not sure why this is needed, it's not used anywhere in the config.
The error message here should be formatted like `err.Error()`
I think this is not the right place to change. This should be done at the level of the table, not the WriteBuilder.
This is a no-op, right?
I think we should check that the record was created with the correct ID.
This is a no-op?
This is a bit of a nit, but I'd prefer if you could import this at the top of the file.
This is not necessary.
`android_keystore_path` should be `android_keystore_path_password`
It seems that we don't need this test anymore.
Is this change required?
@david-winter This is a leak, right?
I would prefer to have these methods on `MethodViewBuilder` rather than on `MethodView`. The reason is that the latter is a private class, so we can't easily change it in the future.
Dynamic overwrite is empty, skipping commit
Line is too long. [124/80]
This is the same as the previous line.
This is a little confusing. The user might expect that this would return the source snapshot link, but it returns the link to the snapshot created by the SDK.
This import was not used anymore.
I'm not sure about this logic, is it a reasonable delay?
@mramato can you help me with this one? I don't quite get it.
The PlaintextAbsoluteUri test is not doing what I expected it to do. It's not testing the absolute URI, but the normalized URI.
@bryevdv @Eric-Arellano I'm not sure what the best way to handle this is. I think it's a bit confusing to have a method that returns a property, but then also have a setter for that property. I think it would be better to make `
I think this should be a relative import.
The `WordPress dependencies` should be removed from this file.
assertEqual is not supported in Python 2.6
Are you sure this is correct? I don't see CONST_SLOT_FIRST defined.
import should be alphabetized
this is a change in behavior?
We think with Ex is better than using 2
This is the only place where this code was used. It's no longer needed, because we're not using the `SwiftASTContext` anymore.
I think this should be `wlr_input_device_destroy` instead of `wlr_libinput_tablet_tool_destroy`
Shouldn't this be `config->http_proxy = NULL;` ?
I would not recommend to use this method. The test is not stable.
this should be a map[string]state.State
Please revert the changes to this file.
I think it would be good to have a package that contains all the imports that are used by this file.
Is this just for consistency with the other errors in this function?
Is this intentional?
please remove empty line
The test was not necessary as `spellcheck` is always set to `false` on `<input>` by default.
This is a good example of why I don't like this sort of thing. I'm not sure what this is supposed to test. It doesn't seem to be measuring anything useful.
The type name should be `TimeDuration` or `Duration` to match the other types.
it will return a promise that resolves to the response object. The promise has cancel method which cancels the ongoing API call.

This is not needed, since the queue is processed in the same thread as the main thread.
I think the wording here is not clear.
This file should be renamed.
This is the fix for #1563.
I think it would be nice to make this a configurable constant in the pipeline. I know it's a small thing but it's a good habit to get into.
Please remove this line.
I think this is a bug.
Is this change related to this PR?
I'm not sure if this is the right place to put it, but I thought it would be a good idea to have it here instead of the default icon, as the default icon is not always present in the app.
nit: unrelated change
I would rename this to `keyStore` as it is more descriptive of what it is.
Why is this needed?
@options[:preserve_host_output] is not defined.
I'm not sure if this is the right change.
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.

Please specify a different data directory with --data-path or specify the original genesis file with --genesis-file.
Shouldn't we add an overload for iOS 10+ that takes a `UIAccessibilityIdentifier` as a parameter?
This change is a little confusing to me. I think we are just using the value of type to determine if we are wifi, data, or airplane mode. We don't care what the value is. So why not just pass the value of type as a String?
The change in the test name is not consistent with the change in the test.

Is this the same as the UInt type?
Why do we need to pass the `ITransactionProcessor` to the `RewardCalculatorFactory`?
I'm not sure what the `nil->non-nil->nil` is supposed to mean here.
Why not just return `model.getSymbolTable().getInterfaces().asList()`?
This doesn't make sense to me. I thought the whole point of the SP was to learn columns.
I'm not sure this is the right place to put the conversion. It seems like it should be in the constructor of the struct.
I'm not sure if this is correct.
@marek-wawrzyniak I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it, but it's the only way I could think of.
nit: We don't have a reason for this, but it seems like we should have a reason.
I think this should be `os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS']` instead of `'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'`
I think we should add a `@return` annotation here.
importpath/Answer
Please use `NamedList<Object>` directly, instead of creating a new one.
I'm not sure this change is needed.
I think it's fine to remove the Get method, but I'm not sure if we should have a `ToDbKey` method on `IDb`. It seems like a more general thing, and it's not used anywhere in this file.
I'm not sure if this is correct. I think it should be the other way around.
Is this line necessary?
`fs.Config.MaxTransferMode` is an enum, so we can't do `fs.Config.MaxTransferMode == fs.MaxTransferModeCautious`

This is the new function I added to support `node.slice` being an `Index` on python 3.9 windows.
This line is not needed.
I'm not sure if this should be info or debug.
test-tag-exclude is not a valid option name
This looks like it's throwing an exception? Is that intentional?
Nit: maybe rename to `resolvedReadersMap` or something?
@jglick - I removed this because I didn't think it was necessary. I'm not sure what the original intent was for this field. I believe it was added to make the code more readable, but it seems to me that it was actually just making the code more confusing.
I'm not sure if this is a good import. The package does not use json at all.
Line is too long. [101/80]
originalData is an array of objects, so it is always a two-dimensional array.
Failed to add type 'System.Reflection.Emit.MethodBuilder': {System.Reflection.Emit.MethodBuilder}
This is not a valid selector.
I think we should also use the singular for the translation.
You can remove this.
I'd rather not have the retry logic here, but in the http_client_init() function. It's not a big deal though.
This will be prefixed by the app, so we can use this prefix to avoid collisions.
Is this just for readability?
I think this is a typo.
Trailing whitespace detected.
Please remove the extra line
Nit: `break` should be on the next line.
This is a change in behavior. It used to return an error. I'm not sure why we're changing this.
This file has been changed in a way that requires a full rebuild of the .NET framework. Please rebuild the .NET framework and run the tests.
I think you need to do this in two separate loops. The reason is that this_name might be a different type than that_name, and you can't do an == comparison between them.
Please add a blank line between the `if` and `else` statements.
These are new API routes.
This should be `fields = fields + ' ' + this.schema.options.discriminatorKey;`
To allow for anonymous access, ensure ServerHttpSecurity.anonymous() is configured.
I think this should be a `Blockly.BlockSvg.NOTCH_HEIGHT_INCLUDED` constant.
I hope life isn't a big joke, because I don't get it.

I'm not sure about the name "combined". I think "combined" is not the right name here. I think "overlap" is more appropriate.
I think it would be better to use the class name here, and to remove the constant.
I'm not sure if we should print this out or not. I'm not sure if this is something we want to expose.
I'm not sure if this is correct. The default bucket is 1s. Shouldn't it be 0.1s?
I'm not sure if we want to do this. This would change the semantics of the command, because currently `nameOrHandle` is used to pass the name or handle of the window. Now it's being used to pass the name or handle of the parameter. I think we should just keep it as
The database file specified could not be opened.

Can you make this a `const char*` string?
I think this is the wrong name. It should be `addEvent`
nit: I would move the for loop into the constructor and inline it.
The menu item is now moved to the `Administration` section.
`mixins` should be added to the `required` array.

Resize all media manager image uploads to be within this width (in pixels, 0 = ignore)
The DockerGraphPath is the only thing that is required.
@sparrowdom This change looks good, but I'm wondering if it's necessary. The reason I ask is because it seems like it's possible to use the bundle's value for DB_NAME even if it's not set.
Repeatedly run randomly selected examples for LIMIT seconds.
@chrsmiths @carryxyh @carryxyh-jira @chrsmiths-jira I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, but I'm not sure where else to put it.
It's not clear why we need to return error here.
`Address value '0x' is not prefixed with 0x`
This is a regression, as it tests that the PriorityQueue's `toPriorityQueue` method does not change the PriorityQueue.
This was causing the test to fail because the node was expecting a string and got a byte slice.
Please add a space after comma.
`item.toJSON` is not defined for all types.
I think this should be an error. The user may have specified the path, and we should let them know that it doesn't exist.
I think we should also have a note here that the flag will be stored in the cluster state of the `withCollection` and points to the collection on which the `withCollection` was specified.

Missing space after comma.
This line is too long. [115/80]
This is an interesting one. The original intention of the code was to make it so that if you called `NodeList.create()` you would get a node list that would be attached to a parent node. But, the code never did that. The only way to get a node list attached to a parent node was
Could this be named something like `OOMWaitingJobMeter` to be more descriptive?
I'm not sure about this. The `metadata` variable is not used anywhere else, so I'm not sure why it is being initialized here. I think we should move the initialization to the `prepareAndRunTest` function.

I'm not sure that we should make this class abstract. It seems that we can make it non-abstract and extend it in the future. What do you think?
Is there a reason why the archive file is not being set here?
Why not just return 0?
@marek-zvelebil this is the only change to the base class, the rest is in the subclasses.
This change is to fix a bug in the code. When there was no query string in the URL, the API and frontend mongoDB were the same. Now, when there is a query string, the API and frontend mongoDB are different.
`config` is a pointer here, so you can use `*json.RawMessage`
@bharatviswa10 I think we can have a single function to create/delete snapshot and use it in both the places.
nit: we can use `final` here
nit: should we remove the TODO here?
I'm not sure this is the best place for this function.
This is the actual fix. The original code would set the result to the return value of the last return statement in the plan.
`LastExecutor` is not used anywhere.
AssertionError: Expected 2 elements in 1.
I think these should be in the `errors` package.

I think this is wrong. If you remove the wait parameter, you're not really making a watcher. You're just creating a Variable that always returns an error.
"Path `{PATH}` ({VALUE}) is before than minimum allowed value ({MIN})."
Histogram edges should be supplied as a tuple along with the values, passing the edges will be deprecated in holoviews 2.0.
I'm not sure about this. If forceRDKit is false, then this is just an alternative implementation of the same thing. If forceRDKit is true, then it is a completely different algorithm, and it is not obvious to me that it is better than the existing one. I think that the
this should be a test for the timeout, not the confirmation.

@garyrussell I think this is an unused attribute, we can remove it
I don't think we need to test for this any more, since the CoreCH algorithm doesn't support CH data.
I think we can use `if !exist` here, because `n.internalNetworkPolicyStore.Get` will return false if the object doesn't exist.
I think we should be consistent with the rest of the codebase and use `callback(error, null)`
Why do we need to do this?
Nit: you could use `err` here instead of `threw`
I think it would be clearer to just do `device_data->enabled_features.core = {};` and then do the check.
This should be exported as `sort-object-map-by-key`
I think this is the only test that actually needs to be changed.
You are using python 2.6, but version 2.7 or greater is required
@rhatdan I think this should be removed

This should probably be "Similar To,Similarity Confidence,State"
Cluster Controller has not yet set OwnerRef
I think we should return `null` here.
I don't think it's necessary to pass `true` to the constructor. If the default value is `true`, you can remove it from the constructor.
Unused block argument `i18n`.
I'm not sure why we need to add these two columns to the `stresschaos` resource. It's a chaos, not a resource.

Can you explain this a bit? I don't see any `nil()` being used in the `partition` method.
The name of the parameter in the method is `plugins`, but in the class it's `plugin`. I think we should keep it consistent.

This is a change in behavior. The previous code would always return a nullptr if the host manager wasn't found. This change will return a valid host manager, which will be created in the HostManager constructor.
Resources are not always present in the model, but if they are, they are always present in the facts.
I would say "minimum" rather than "maximum"
This is going to be an issue in the future. This will need to be increased to 100 or more.
I'm a little confused by the interface{} in this signature. I would expect it to be `Plugin` or `ManagedPlugin`. Is this just for the type system?
Why change this?
This is the same as above.
This method is not needed anymore.
This seems to be a bug fix?
Shouldn't it be `destroy` instead of `destory`?
if cls._timeout == socket._GLOBAL_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT:

It seems that the check should be inside the function, not here.
I think you need to check that `spOutput` is a subset of `expectedOutput`.
This is needed because the old version of `data` did not raise an error when called with `None` as an argument.
Should this be a `var` or a `const`?
I think it's better to use the full name of the compiler, e.g. `nvcc` -> `nvcc-cuda`
This is a duplicate of line 120
This should be `expr.High.Type().Underlying().(*types.Basic)`
Should we rename this method to `getArrowGlacierBaseFeePerGas`?
Line is too long. [81/80]
this is not a method, so the signature is not needed
If size_count is 0, we want to check that the blocks are empty, right?
QueryRelation queryRelation -> QueryRelation query
I think this can be simplified to `source?.GetDictionary(ConfigurationKeys.ServiceNameMappings)?.ToDictionary(kvp => kvp.Key.Trim(), kvp => kvp.Value.Trim())?.ToDictionary(kvp => kvp.Key.Trim(), kvp
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
This panic is not needed, as `MakeRandomID` returns an error when the random seed is not available.
I'm not sure why this is not using the new `material-icons` class.
I don't think this is necessary.
I think this should be "1.3 GB"
Why not return the error from reviseRootDir?
This doesn't seem like a default method.
This test is redundant with test_completion_item_focus_with_no_model.
Why is this change required?
This name is misleading, because it's not just any elements that are located, but the elements that are visible.

This should be api_sig_key
@domenkozar @garbas @matthewbauer @grahamc - is this something we should do in the Travis image?
I think we can use a test fixture to create the expected result
why we need this change?
this method should return bool.
`hash` can be None, and it's not used if it's not provided.
I think this change is unrelated to the fix.
Why is this change needed?
Can you add a dependency on `pyspark` here?
Unused method argument - product_type. If it's an optional argument, use _ or _product_type as an argument name to indicate that it won't be used.
@mfojtik can you add this to the docstring please?
Please don't use `{` and `}` in one line.
'username and password is required'
This is the wrong way around, the second part of the sentence should be after the comma.
I would suggest to use metric names `sonm_tasks_current` and `sonm_deals_current` instead of `sonm_tasks` and `sonm_deals`
I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do. The offset should be relative to the start of the file, not the current position. If the file is empty, then this will skip to the end of the file. I think it should be the opposite.
Is this a bit of a smell? I'm not sure I like that we have to pass in `target.SteadyStateDependencies` as a parameter to `verifyStatusResolvable`. It feels like we're passing in too much information, but I'm not sure what the alternative is
I think this should be a private method.
Why is this change needed?
<div id="t1"><em></em></div><div id="t2"><em></em></div>
I think this can be done in the StallBlockOp, so that we don't have to pass the block server around.
I'm a little confused by this change. Why is it better to use `callable` instead of `hasattr`?
@mfojtik - I think we should make this a non-fatal error. The user should be able to see the infraID on the provision object.
I would not use `asFunc` here, but `beforeQuery` as a parameter name.
Is this needed?
InboundMiddleware and OutboundMiddleware
Nit: I'd rename this method to something like `signatureFromComponents`.
@adambkaplan @brycemayr - I'm not sure if I should be removing these from the list of prelude packages or not. I think I'm supposed to keep them, but I'm not sure.
Please remove the empty line here.
Should this be `GoGapicContext` instead of `Object`?
Align the parameters of a method call if they span more than one line.
This is not compatible with the latest version of Python 3.8, right? I think we'll need to bump this to 0.9.0.
I'm not sure if this is correct, as it seems to be a breaking change.
Nit: I would use snake_case for these constants.
Line is too long. [127/80]
This is a change to the API. I don't think we should be doing this in a release.
This import is not needed anymore, right?
`nodeTran` can be nullable
"ATTENTION: The schemas in new version are less than the old version, which may cause compatibility problems."
This will break existing code, I think.
Shouldn't we be checking the checksum here?
The same as the other one.
@liggitt is this ok?
> managed identity can not be used at the same time as clientID, tenantID or clientSecret
Line is too long. [113/80]
@chrisvest I'm not sure this is the best example of what I'm trying to do. I'm thinking about how to get the kind of the declaration. The idea is to use a more specific node type as a cue to get the kind of the declaration.
We should add this to the configuration file.
@smarterclayton can you explain why we removed this part?
I think it's more correct to set it to 0 here.
This is a breaking change. I think we should only do this if `aURL.startsWith("data:")` and `SessionStore.get().isCurrentSessionPrivate()`.
I think the error is because of the panic in the next line?
I think this is not necessary. You can use `self.my_int` directly.
Please add a TODO to fix this.
<div style="padding: 0;">
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid time zone ID: +0200
This is a very bad idea. It's a bad idea because it's not random at all. It's pseudo-random. If you want a truly random ID, use the PHP built-in mt_rand() function.
nit: should we call this method `buildTableMetadata` instead of `tableMetadata` ?
self.window = window
I don't think we should be changing the behavior of this function. It is used in many places.
I think you need to add a space before the equals sign here.
@mfojtik this is the only change in this PR, the rest is just cleanup.
This is the only place where we use `this.plugin.uppy` in the `Dashboard` plugin. We could probably just use `uppy` here.
Could not find a backup repository with name
This function is not used.
Shouldn't be possible; the map is pre-allocated.
Can you add a license header?
Can we add a note here to explain that this is the default behaviour?
This line is not indented 4 spaces
Output is not required.
I don't think this is the right way to do this. It's not that `virtual_vdims` are not supported, but that `virtual_vdims` are only supported if `key` is set. So, if we want to support both `virtual_vdims`
The `this.splashWindow.close();` can be called in `onDestroy` instead.
P:   Precision (1==float, 2==double, 3==int32_t, 4==int64_t)
This method is not implemented
I'm not sure about this. If we're not using a schema file, then we're not using a schema file. I don't think we should be changing the signature of this method.
Please remove this file.
Number of items in a list (example output: list with 5 items).
System.out.println("  targetHasArcs");
The base clock frequency of host controller in MHz.
I think this should be `ProxySettings.DEFAULT_PROXY_SETTINGS`
I'm not sure about this, it's a little weird to have a role and not be DT or DD. But I'm not sure if there is a better way to handle this.
Just send <enter>
I think this should be a `LinkedHashMap` instead of a `TreeMap` to preserve the insertion order.
I don't think this is the right way to do it. This should be a comma separated list of interfaces to exclude.
This file is missing a copyright header.
The same for the other methods
This is not needed, as the app.CreateSettingsFile() is already called in the main() function.
I would suggest to call this `super` as it is the first constructor in the hierarchy.
Class Cms\Classes\MediaLibrary has been deprecated, use System\Classes\MediaLibrary instead.
@garyrussell do you know if this method is still used?
I'm not sure why this file was included.
@jasonwryan , what do you think about removing the queue and just re-doing the traversal each time we hit a NO_OUTPUT?
Enabling aggressive sysstat polling
This seems like a very simple logic, but it is a bit tricky to get it right. For example, if a flow is in queue and the processing is failed, then it is still in queue, right?
I think the naming here is a bit inconsistent. I'd rather see: platformAWS = "aws" platformAzure = "azure" platformGCP = "GCP" platformBaremetal = "baremetal" platformUnknown = "unknown platform" regionUnknown = "unknown region"

It seems that we're missing the check for balance being 0.
location.value.long, should not be read -> location.value.long, should not be read
tdnf error (will continue if the only errors are toybox conflicts):
This is not needed.
nit: `Propagate skewFromParent to local spans` is not really clear.
nit: remove extra newline
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
Is there a way to test this function?
This will break all the tests. You need to check the return value of `fileutil.FgrepStringInFile`.
Align the elements of a hash literal if they span more than one line.
This should be `null === $providerReference`
@siddhantk123 is this right?
I think `hasAttr('selected')` is a more efficient selector, as it doesn't have to do a DOM traversal.
Did you mean to move this?
I'm not sure about this. It's not really an improvement, and I think that the code would be better if the only change was to add the second argument to the call to `$this->productDataReferenceInjector->loadReferences()`
> It is also used to keep the metadata of containers managed by the agent regardless of whether "Checkpoint" is set. It is also used to keep the metadata of containers managed by the agent regardless of whether "Checkpoint" is set.
I think this is a good idea. It makes it more obvious that this is a function that should be called before anything else.
nit: you could use `f'{BATCH_SIZE_MAP.get(x, (10, 10))}`
Should this be an enum?
This was causing the tests to fail.
I'm not sure if we need the word "based" here, but I guess it's not a big deal.
Please remove this null value.
This is the only change I see in this PR, so it should be a separate PR.
"Zero_count Argument cannot exist without count!"
Is this a case where we should have a separate VUID for each of these?
@chrsmith this is what I'm thinking of. Is it OK to just use the default ssh port? I think we can't assume that people will be using the same port as we do internally.
import "github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node/core/location/factory"
I'm not sure if this is the right way to fix this. I think it might be better to move the SubstructMatch() call to the end of the function.
The move of the resultColNames_ here is not needed, because the variable is a std::unique_ptr.
This should be in a separate PR.
@rhatdan this is the code you asked for
This seems like a good candidate for a new enum type.
`pin-mongos` should be removed from here, it's not a reason to skip a test
Line is too long. [125/80]
I'm not sure about this. It's a bit confusing, but I guess it's OK.
I think this can be `new CaseInsensitiveMap<>(StructType.class, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER)`
this is a bit odd. I would prefer the import order to be in alphabetical order.
I would use `splitlines` instead of `split` for the sake of readability.
SQLITE3: SQLITE3{SQLite3File:	"./explorer.db",}
This is not the right fix. I'm going to make a PR to fix it.
IBlockchainProcessor mainChainProcessor = null

Nit: this is a map of strings to struct{}? Is there a reason we can't just use a set of struct{}?
R:  { path: '/mongodb', host: 'localhost', port: 27017, authdb: null, socketPath: null, ssl: false, sslValidate: false, sslCAFile: null, sslCAPath: null, sslKeyFile: null, sslCertFile
this is not the correct type
I think it would be more clear to call the secondary the "replica" here.
Why not use a `defer` statement here?

This is the fix. It was happening because of a bug in the JavaFX code.
This should be a `memset` or `clear_str` or something like that.
This file is missing a license header.
amount of <%= number_to...
@golimo @rhatdan @mfojtik @chrsmith I'm not sure why this was removed, but it seems to be causing a build failure.
@sorenther @garyrussell do you know if this is correct? I was under the impression that `byteslice` should take a start and end index, but the error message makes it look like it's taking the whole array.
I think this function name is a bit misleading. The output is not a password hash.
The `path === '_id'` check is redundant, since `_id` is a reserved path.
Style/UnneededParenthesizedBlock: Parenthesize the body of a block if it has a single expression.
combaination -> combination
This is not the right place to do this. You should do it in the `GenCode` method below.
Space missing after comma.
The file is not changed, please remove this file from the PR.
I think you want to say "at least" here.
Nit: Sugar() is a function, not a variable.
Is there a way to fix this so we don't have to skip it?
This is not the correct fix. The problem is that the `roles` value is not defined as a string. The correct fix is to make sure that `roles` is a string and not an array.
What is the purpose of this change? I don't see how this would fix the problem.
This seems like a good place to log the number of aggregates that are being refreshed.
I'm not sure we should be doing this, but it's a simple change.
I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but it looks like the nuspec file is not getting updated.
Is there a reason why you need to cast the metric? I'm asking because it seems like you are only casting it to IGaugeMetric, which is not necessary since you are using the LastValue.Value.ToString() method.
The `true` and `false` here are not needed.

The resulting PCAP file might contain invalid packets.

Please use relative imports.
Is this a good idea? If we have this, we should also have a `GetShardKey()` method in `ReqMeta` as well.
I think we should call this `PeerTrackerAttestorClient` instead.
spaceLock.unlock_shared() will not be called if the try_lock_shared() failed?
Properties added with WithProperty or SetProperty
This seems like a pretty big change, especially if the OAI server is initialized in the constructor. It might be worth it to keep the old code in place until the 1.8 release and then remove it.
@pjcozzi do we want to delete the network-audit-results.json as well?
Runtime kernel version: Linux 4.4.0-1062-gcp
This is not the only place where we need to check for this, and it's a bit confusing to me that we're using a FolderBranch here.
I think it's better to use `configs.MemoryUnlimited` here.
@mheon @smarterclayton is this the right error message?
This is not related to this PR.
self._storage_class = resp.getheader(provider.storage_class_header, None)

I think this is the wrong config for the `UsageReportingInitialDelaySecs` field. I'm pretty sure it should be `time.Duration` and not `string`.
Please use `typeof` to check if the variable is undefined
`IdentifyForChat` is a bit of a misnomer, as it's not just for chat. I think `IdentifyForUser` would be better, or `IdentifyForUserWithTrackBreaks`
I'm not sure why this is needed. The test itself sets the block time to 100ms.
This flag should be called `promise.amount`
127.0.0.1:1234
Is it worth moving these to a static method in the logging utility class?
Line is too long. [115/80]
This is not correct. It will always return `true` if `nowPlayingItem.RunTimeTicks` is `0`. You need to do this check in the if statement: `if (nowPlayingItem.RunTimeTicks > 0) {`
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
This filter is no longer needed, as the `ModuleSettingsDetails` component has been removed.
I'm not sure this is the right name. It seems to me that it should be `GSUITE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_ID`.
Is this the correct number of cores per socket?

We should probably add some context here.
Why is this default 0?
This method should be removed
this seems wrong to me, stereoanys are allowed to be connected to each other
I'm not sure if this should be a default value or not. It might be better to have it as `DEFAULT NULL` so that we don't have to worry about setting it on inserts.
Please remove empty line.
If we want to have a `stop` function that is thread-safe, we should have a `stop` function that is thread-safe.

I'm not sure this is the right place to add this. The priority is part of the match and should be added there.
We can remove this.
why change the value of the length?
@author Maxime Steinhausser
I think this is a little confusing. If I have a volume that is not bound to a policy, then it should not be bound to a policy. I think we should just use the policy name and not have the policy variable at all.

@kriswilson @nvazquez @bjunce @chamikaramj @jvillalobos - please review this change.

I'm not sure if this is correct. I think the ReviewBlockTree should be run before the InitializePlugins.
I'm not sure what this line is doing. It's not a logical OR, but I'm not sure what it is.
I think it's better to use `if c.Data["IsApiToken"].(bool) {`
This is not needed. It is the responsibility of the client to provide the correct annotation.

#include <assert.h> should be moved to the top of the file

This is a bit confusing, as it's not the git hash of the server, but the git hash of the package that is being installed. I'd prefer if we renamed it to `PackageVersion` or something like that.
Should we use the "aws" package here?
Please remove the extra empty line.
why this change?
I think we can remove this and just have it default to jx_input.
@rhtyds @cicdwang @maarcingebala can you please help me fix this? I'm not sure how to fix this
Should we log the error somewhere?
Nit: I think it would be more clear to have this function return `bool` and the `if` below be `if !isCpuSet(cgroup) { return nil }`
This is the same thing as the above.
`c._nextState==null` is always true, because `c._nextState` is never set.

nit: I would prefer to use the W3C command name here, as this is the same as the name used in the spec.
I'm not sure about this change. I think it's a breaking change.
I think this is the most important change.
I am not sure if this is correct, but I don't think it is, as it will not allow to catch the exception in the test suite.

@stephentoub - I was not sure what the behavior of `Increment` was if you specified a `string[]` with more than one key. I am guessing this will still count both, but not sure if there is a way to get this to fail.

I'm not sure if this change is correct. I think the original code is correct.
I don't understand this line. What does it do?
I think this is the change that was causing the build failure.
this is a very small value, I would recommend using 1e-15 or 1e-16

assertTrue(sw.toString(), sw.toString().contains("JavascriptCompiler$CompiledExpression.evaluate(" + source + ")"));
I think it's fine to do this, but it seems like it would be cleaner to have a separate "defaultRuntimeNameProvider" that is just the compiler name.
I think you should also add a method to get the response type name from the config, if the response type is not provided by the method.
I don't think we need to do this. The `form` prop is already a special case, so we should be able to just remove it from the set and not worry about it.
Please add a new line here.
These two props are not used anywhere in this file.
This is not the right place for this, it should be in the workflow struct itself.

The `googlesitkeit-user-input__notification` class is applied to all of the input components, which is a bit confusing to me. Can we instead apply this class to the `<input>` element only?
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.

typo: holds
Please add a space after the "i" in "maximum".
I'm not sure if this is correct, but it seems like it should be.
This is a bit of a hack. We should be able to get rid of it by moving the default to the costing module.
I'm not sure what this does, but it's not used anywhere, so I removed it.
@matt-gardner @tgamblin @saghul @kalefranz any thoughts on this? I think this is what we want, but I'm not sure.
I think it's fine to leave this file alone. It doesn't have any new imports.
Style/StringLiterals: Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
I think this is the same as the one above, and you can remove the second one.

should this be in the ifaceName == "tunl0" check?
@smarterclayton is this ok?
Nit: you can just use sizeof(bool) here.
Nit: the return type is not used
I'd rather have a method `isRegularInterfaceAnnotation` instead of a `isRegularInterface`
Should this be false or true?
Nit: these patterns are very specific to the CLI. Would it make sense to move them to the `compute-image-tools` project?
Nit: The import order here is not alphabetical.
This function is not used.
Is this change related to the test?

The function name is not very descriptive. Maybe "Delete" is more appropriate.
Nitpick: You should remove the trailing comma here.
Is this a test that we really want to have? It seems like it is a test that would be very hard to write.
This line is too long. [83/80]
I think it would be better to assert that opt_port is a number, string, or boolean. I think that would be a better match for the other calls to assert() in this file.
Is this message correct? I'm wondering if it should be something like "Found non-standard cron schedule '{self._cron_schedule}' for schedule '{name}''." instead.

I don't know if it's the best approach to remove the ignore annotation here, but it's the only way I can make this test work.
I think we should remove these from the state interface as well.
Shouldn't this be called `RevisionIn` instead?

I'm not sure this is the right way to do this. I think we should still have the CRD name in the list options, and then just not check the error.
@slavkapu @nmittler @pabloem do you think it would be better to have this visitor in `FilterNode`? I'm not sure if it makes sense to have it in `QueryNode`
This is the default value, so you can remove it.
why checkCoinbase is needed here?
import order is wrong
This is an interesting change, but I think it is going to cause some confusion. I think it would be better to have this feature in the ITransportConnectionFeature interface and have the IConnectionHeartbeatFeature implement it. Then, I think it would be better to have the IConnectionLifetimeNotification
I'm not sure if we should drop the table and recreate it every time we restart the server. I think we should be able to use the existing table and only update the data if it's needed.

I think this change is not needed.
This is a breaking change.

I'm not sure about this. I think it's a good idea to have a service account name in the role name, but I'm not sure if it's good to have the namespace in the role name. I'm wondering if it would be better to have the namespace in the role binding
This is not needed anymore.
I think you can just use `accounts` here.

This is not right, we need to pass the current config.
Is this the right place to catch the exception?
I'm not sure if this is the right way to do this. The code for GetXattr() is not used anywhere else. I think it would be better to just have GetXattr() return the value of the xattr or 0 if it doesn't exist.
I think we can just remove the `data` from the method name and use `table.currentSnapshot().manifests()` everywhere

I don't think we should do this. We should just let the connection fail and then the user can fix it. We should not retry the connection forever.

Exception in asynchronous handler.
I think we should remove this import.

Why is this changed?
I'm not sure this is right. I think this will break all of the tests that were written to catch a `MongoParseError`.

@michaelkuhn: I'm not sure if this is the right way to handle this. I'm trying to figure out if it's safe to remove this test.
@smarterclayton this should be moved to a different PR.
Please remove this.
This doesn't look like a very performant algorithm, but it's probably not a problem.
This validation is done twice, once in the getter and once in the setter. The getter is called when the property is set, so it's not necessary.
This test case is very simple and doesn't really test anything. It would be better to add a test that verifies that the buffer can be written completely, even if it is larger than 2GB.
nit: wasHiveString_ is not needed here.
Please fix formatting
This is a link to a file, not a URL.
I don't see how this avoids exceptions in debug mode. It looks like the same thing is happening.

@jgsugar @sjimenez @daviddavison @chamikaramj @matt-peters I have removed this line. This class is only used for the `copy_to_test_db` fixture, and it's not used anywhere else.
Prefer double-quoted strings unless you need single quotes to avoid extra backslashes for escaping.
I think it's better to use `max_blocking_time_point - std::chrono::system_clock::now()` to get the current time.
This is a new API.
Why is this swap necessary?
I'm not sure about this one. Shouldn't the test be for a parent <dlitem>?
Is this still needed?
I'm not sure if this is correct, but I'm guessing that this is the way to indicate that this parameter is an out parameter.
@jayjacobs This is the part I'm confused about. I'm not sure why this is a breaking change.

Is this the right way to do this?
This should be done in the `resetPassword()` method, and the `$url` should be set to `APP_URL` in the `resetPassword()` method, not in the `restore_onSubmit()` method.
I think we should move this code to the main loop.
@jridgewell I removed this because it was never used. I'm not sure if we should have a separate vendor prefix for Chrome or if we should just use the vendor prefix for the browser.
This looks like a bug. The error should be propagated to the caller.
We should probably use defers to ensure things that started up successfully are stopped before we exit.
`self.assertIsInstance(api_response, dict)` is not needed, it's already covered by `self.assertDictEqual(api_response, {'SetStackPolicyResult': {'Some': 'content'}})`
I'm not sure if this is the right name for this. I think maybe we should call it `offset` or something like that?
Please add package name.
This should be in the `machine` package, not here.
I think this should be optional. It's not part of the protocol, so if the GA client doesn't know about it, it should ignore it.

We don't have any CSRF protection in place?
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, since it might lead to confusion. It would be better to have a different name for the `chooseFile` method, so that it's clear that it's not the standard one.
I think you can use `self.text()[0]` here.

@tlauda @slava-semenov I think these are better as ints. I know it's not a big deal but I like to have the type of the variable as close to the usage as possible. Also, it's better for the future maintainer.
@bryevdv this will not work, because if you have a POST or PUT with a body, it will be sent to the server and the connection will be closed.

This should be fine, but we should remove it once we switch to the new library.
Nit: I think we can remove this import now.
The name of this variable is a bit confusing, as it's not the start time of the task, but the start time of the failure. Perhaps it should be named 'start_time' or something similar.
This was an assertion that was never really necessary, because it's guaranteed that `system.RunCommand` will never return an error.

I don't think we should be raising an error here. I think we should be ignoring the config and not adding the log. If we're not going to log it, we should just ignore it.

I'm wondering if this should be a member variable, so it's available for all the methods of the class.
This should be removed.
remove empty line
This is going to be very expensive for large streams. We should be sending only the source information.
@wagnerjohan: I think the issue is that `message` is not defined in the dictionary, but the type of the value is `str`
I'm not sure if this is the right place for this function. I think it would be better to have it in the task package.
`value` can be `None` too, so we need to check for that as well.
I think the right type should be `constvalue`
I think this should be `os.path.join(args.config_directory, 'Default.sqlite')`
This is a very small change, but it is one of the most important ones in this PR. I've been wondering why we are not publishing the state event here, but it was not until I was writing the tests that I realized that we need to do it.
I'm not sure what the feedbackable is for, it doesn't seem to be used anywhere.
The size of datum_vector must be equals to transformed_blob->num()
This change seems unrelated.
This seems like a pretty big change. Can you explain why it is better to cast to an int64 and then back to an int than to just use an int?
The test suite now contains 10 tests.
Why not register the listener before sortFiles?
I don't think we should change the code to use long, since we are not using it in the loop. The loop is using int.
If we can't guarantee that the values are not old, then why are we using a value from the database? I would expect that the value would be approximate anyway, because it's been a while since the last time the count was updated.
I'm not sure this change is correct. It's possible that a class could have been declared as `final` but not actually have a body. In that case, the `getSource()` method would return `null`.
The method generateId() is not used.
I would suggest to use the same field names for the test as in the implementation. It's not a big deal but it helps to understand the test.
bbox_feats.shape[0] > 0 is mean the number of proposal is not 0.
I don't see any code using the typeWidth.
Why is this changed?
I don't think we should be disabling this rule.
let url = `${API_URL}/photos/random`; let headers = {}; headers.Authorization = `Client-ID ${testApplicationID}`; headers['Accept-Version'] = API_VERSION; return fetch(url, {headers}) .then((response) => this._checkStatus(response));
I think we should be using the sdk/instrumentation package for the instrumentation, rather than the lib/instrumentation package.
Is it possible to have two nodes with the same ID? If not, then I think this can be a const.
`IoULoss`, `GIoULoss`, or `DIoULoss`
@gofrederick is it ok to change the default to `buildStatic=false`? I think it's fine, but I wanted to double check before I did it.
@rhtyd @matthewaime @chrsmith @slavkap I'm not sure if this is the right way to fix the issue. I'm not sure what the right way to fix this is, but I think it's better than the way I did it.
The `Enable` check is redundant here.
destinationClusterIP and destinationServiceName are not used anywhere
I don't see where this is used, so this may not be needed.
Nit: I'd prefer this to be called `trieStore.AsReadOnly()`
I think it would be better to just say "current fee" rather than "optimal" since it is the fee that is currently being used by the wallet.
I'm not sure if this is right.
Line is too long. [82/80]
@siddontang this is the only change in this PR. The others are to make sure the PR compiles.
This is a very minor thing, but it would be nice if this were called `getSequenceNumber` instead of `sequenceNumber`.
`netloc` is not used in this function.
this is not a great name for the directory. maybe etcdBackupDir?
This is wrong.
database capacity in chunks (and in Bytes): 256 (256*1024)
Shouldn't this be `public function getByUuid(string $uuid): Flag[]` ?
Why not remove this?
Nit: I think it's clearer to say "GetHost" rather than "GetAbsoluteUrl"
The `include` call will throw an exception if the file doesn't exist. This will prevent that.
Is this the only place where we need to set the context?
@n3nash I think this should be in the core module.
@davidjumani this is the list of rule files that are required for Forseti V1.
why is this change?
Uncaught Error: Unable to parse content of /Users/michael-stuhlhofer/Developer/workspace/saleor/tests/fixtures/orders/order-test-data.json
`swarm.ZeroAddress` is not an error, so this is a bit misleading.
@christopherhabig I'm not sure about this one, I think the width is already 100% and the maxWidth is set to 200% which makes it 200% of the parent element which is 100% of the window.
Nit: Can we call this something like "umask_restrict"?
nit: I'd call this `is_gpu_svd` or `is_gpu_pca_svd`
nit: this is a bit redundant since the `service = getDefaultService()` is called in the next line.
nit: unnecessary newline
IsXNullableReturnType is always true for header response.
Please remove this unused import
LabelHardwareEncoding -> HardwareEncoding
This should be kept. It's used in `Browser.getDefaultService`.
Nethermind.Blockchain.Bloom > Nethermind.Blockchain > Nethermind.Blockchain.Bloom
Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or special symbols.
`integration` -> `Integration`
Is there a reason this isn't just `for (auto& output : location_map)`?
@pmeier This method is called by `RowKey` in `Row.java`.
This line is too long. Please split it over multiple lines.
I think it would be better to add a new method `hasLongrunningReturnValue()` to `OptionalArrayMethodView` instead of adding a new abstract method to `OptionalMethodView`. This is because `OptionalArrayMethodView` is not supposed to be used in a `long-running operation`.
This is not a good solution. It's better to just skip this call if wxLang is None.
Do we want to make this an enum?
This import is unused.
I think this will break if you're using a key that's not in the `self.keys` list, right?
`gpuMining` -> `gpuMiningEnabled`
I think we should be able to remove this.
I think it's not necessary to check for the shibboleth-method here. If the config is set, it's always set for shibboleth.
Line is too long. [104/80]
Contexts created with `tchannel.ContextWithHeaders` are incompatible with yarpc clients generated from thrift. Using such a context will cause a yarpc client to error on any call. Using the `sanitize-tchannel` flag will generate a yarpc client such that all t
I don't think this is the right place to make this change.
Using Datadog.Trace.ExtensionMethods
Align the parameters of a method call if they span more than one line.
Line is too long. [82/80]
"The returned MDs are the same instances that are stored in the MD cache, so they should be modified with care."
nit: "transfer full" is a bit of a mouthful. I'd just call it "full" here.
Why do we need to call FinishSizePrefixed here?
Is there a way to get rid of this line?
> x. This is the Q-function: the tail probability of the normal distribution.
@jgaskins this is the fix, but I'm not sure what the best way to test this is
I'm not sure why this is necessary, but I guess it is?
Shouldn't this be `Worker` instead of `Server`?
"Additional parameters for the {0} operation."
The package name should be `org.openqa.selenium.grid.distributor.remote.test`.
unknown setence type[10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
I think we can remove this file now.
@cramforce I don't think this is a good name for this. This is a hint for the code editor, not the code itself. It's a hint for the code editor that is used to display code hints in the editor.
The option description is missing here.
This is a bit confusing to me. If you want to replace `\\` with `_` why don't you just replace `\\` with `_` in the `replacements` dict?
Do we need this? I don't see where it is used.
I don't think this is the correct way to add a new option. I think we should add this to the end of the list of options.
This log message is misleading. This route is not ignored because it has no destination, it is ignored because it has no link index.
This is a breaking change, so I'm not sure it's worth it. We'll need to test that it works in all of our tests.
thanostypes
The data on the usage dashboard is historical in nature. This means that the number of records below may not match the count shown on the usage dashboard. For example if one of your users created a plan in October and then removed that plan in November, it would have been included on the usage dashboard's
Why is this in the API?
I think this is wrong, as it is not initialized to NULL, but to an empty string.
This should be a duckv1.Source.
@cramforce I think this is the one.
@dmitr111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
This method is called twice, once in `TestCreateBlock` and once in `TestCreateBlockWithActionIterator`. Shouldn't we be testing it once?
I don't think this is the right fix, since bison is not a binary, but a compiler.
This file should be named `main.cpp`
I don't think this is the right place to do this. The aliasesManager.update() is not a synchronous call. The retry should be done in the aliasesManager.update() method.
Shouldn't this be `defined(PLATFORM_IS_FREEBSD)`?
Expected example to fail since it is pending, but it passed.
I'm not sure if we want to support `toArray` here. The goal is to provide a `List` interface, but we're not sure if we want to support `toArray`. I think the current approach is fine, but if we do want to support `toArray` here, we
This is a change in behaviour. The original code waited until RXD was ready before reading it. This code will read it before it is ready. I think the original code was better.
> [](start = 35, length = 1) Please add a space after the opening bracket.
why does it change?
Please remove this blank line.
@johanb I don't think this is the best place to do this. It's a bit hacky and I'm not sure if it's the best way to go. I'm going to think about this some more.
I'm not sure this is the right way to do it, but it's what I've found in the docs.
This should be `network string`
Can we rename this to `tab_muted`?
This is the same as `c.PutHash` above, but for the sake of consistency, I added it here as well.
I'm not sure if we should use `str` here. It's not a very good practice to compare strings with `==` or `is` operators. It's better to use `==` for numbers and `is` for objects.
Shouldn't this be `github.com/spiffe/spire/proto/spire/api/server/entry/v1beta1`?
nit: the "bad file handle?" is no longer necessary, as it's already in the "shouldn't fail"
This one seems to be unused.
Can you remove the space after the comma please?
I think this change is unrelated to the PR?
I think we should use the same interface for both.
$performanceTestSample = null;
Can we do a type annotation on this?
This should be `return res, encodedError, appErr` right?
Use 2 (not 0) spaces for indentation.
FlattenedMethodAsyncCallSettings, FlattenedMethodAsyncCancellationToken, PagedOptionalArrayMethod, // C#
$this->setTargets($target);
Nit: `https` is a bit confusing here, I would just say `...attributes`.
This change is not required.
I think you can remove this include.
I think this should be `string.Join("\n", accessionNumDict.Select(pair => pair.Value));`
Layout/EmptyLinesAroundClassBody: Extra empty line detected at class body end.
I think it's not a good idea to return nil and log the error here. If the user wants to continue, he should be able to do it.
assertEquals("01", h.query(req("q","*:*", "wt","velocity",VelocityResponseWriter.TEMPLATE,"foreach")).trim());
This method is already defined in `Order`.
Line is too long. [126/80]
Nit: I'd just call this "noop" to be consistent with the other code.
SynchronizeVersion should be moved up here, since it's not dependent on the core project.
This should be `menu.findItem(R.id.settings).setVisible(false);`
@sureshanaparti I don't think we need to pass the activity here. The method is already expecting an Activity.
This is a breaking change, and will require updating the SQLAlchemy dialects for PostgreSQL and MySQL to use the same default timeout.
Can't find role role_admin
I don't think we need to do this. I'm not sure if it will break anything, but I don't think we should do this.
I'd suggest making these `cniNetwork` and `cniIPAM` as well.
`null` is not a good value for `manifest` and `io`. I'd suggest to add an overload of `ManifestFiles.read(..)` that takes `Manifest` and `FileSystem` as arguments.
`se/grid/newsessionqueue` -> `se/grid/sessionqueue`
Is this intent extra needed?
Time: 0.002 seconds
Is this assertion going to be removed?
scope_up(out); out << indent() << "g_free (&" << name << ");" << endl; scope_down(out); out << indent() << "return " << error_ret << ";" << endl; out << indent() << "xfer += ret;" << endl;
I'm not sure this is the right thing to do. It's a little bit like saying "if I don't have a car, I'm going to buy one". If we don't have a synchronizable entities prefix, we shouldn't be trying to create one.
This is now a bit different, it's now a single command to remove all old packs, but it still reports the number of packs removed.
This method name is misleading, it doesn't return the number of pending documents. It returns the number of documents in the index including documents are being added (i.e., reserved).
nit: the value is too big. 1000 * 1000 is 1MiB. 10 * 1000 * 1000 is 100MiB.
I'm not sure if we need a translation for this message.
@cramforce should we be passing `data` to `getDataErrorComponent`?
I think we should use the version number that we get from the Salesforce SDK Manager.
Why is this switch statement needed? It's not used anywhere.
Is this empty request always a valid request? If not, it should be a valid request.
reg=15, 15-bit, last reg=15
Line is too long. [121/80]
Block has too many lines. [102/25]
this should be a pointer.
This will fail if the error message is not empty.
Is this the same as the `timeSrc` and `timeDst` in the `execute.AggregateConfig`?
This is a breaking change.
