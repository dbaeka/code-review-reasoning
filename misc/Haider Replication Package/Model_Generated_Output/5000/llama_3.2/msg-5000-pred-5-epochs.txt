This is an interesting one. We want to init the XDP state even if the BPF is disabled. The question is whether this is a good idea.

The `m_renderPass_dependencies` is a `std::vector<GLadevices::RenderPassDependency>`, and the `m_additionalSubpassDependencies` is a `std::vector<GLadevices::RenderPassDependency>` as well. So, it looks like we are adding to the same vector here. So, the line `m_renderPass_dependencies.insert(m_renderPass_dependencies.end(), m_additionalSubpassDependencies.begin(), m_additionalSubpassDependencies.end());` should be fine, as it is doing a copy of the entire `m_additionalSubpassDependencies` to `m_renderPass_dependencies`.

So we're returning true here, and then in the endpoint configuration, we're still doing a `TryGet` and returning false if the app setting isn't set.
