This is a bit confusing. I think it's better to use `IsGenesis` directly.
I think this should be `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` only.

I think this should be `moveToNotebook`
I think this is a good change.
I think this is a bug.
This is a bit of a hack, but I think it's the best way to get the thread name.
This is the only change in this file.
NIT: I think we can remove the `o` variable here.

This is a bit of a hack, but it's the only way I could get the tests to run.

TODO: add ExecMetrics when guicy
I think this should be `edge.ServiceBuilder`
I think this is a bug. The `opc.Issuer` should be added to the list of trusted keys.
I think this is a bug fix.
I think we should be able to remove the `this.options` parameter from the `resolveReadConcern` and `resolveWriteConcern` functions.
NIT: I think this should be `StringArrayEqualityComparer.Default`
I think this should be `import Button from '../assets/js/components/button';`
I think we should add the fields that are used in the query.
This is a bug fix.
I think this should be `arn:aws:sqs:eu-west-1:000000000000:testq:test-queue`
Layout/TrailingWhitespace: Trailing whitespace detected.

I think this should be `qutebrowser-` instead of `qutebrowser-prefix-`
I think this is a bug fix.
Line is too long. [101/80]
"Allow for unprotected (non EIP155 signed) transactions to be submitted via RPC (default: ${DEFAULT-VALUE})"
I think this should be `isinstance(name, (tuple, type(None)))`
remove empty line
I think this should be a number of threads.
nit: I think this should be `String.format(..)`
I think this is a bug. The error message should be "Expecting a numeric status code or '*', got '" + what + "'".
This is not needed.
This is a bit of a hack, but it works.
> src/__tests__/test-utils.js:1:17: error: Cannot find module '../../src'
I think this is a good idea, but I'm not sure what the new name should be.
I think this is not needed.
I think this should be GET_CONTEXT_INFO
This is not a good idea. The class attribute is used to add a CSS class to the element. If you add a class to the element, you should not add another class to the element.
Generate Json schema
I think this should be `aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:2.0`
I think this should be `mdDecryptionKeyGetter`
The caller can specify `desiredKeyGen` to force a server check if that particular key gen isn't yet known; it may be set to UnspecifiedKeyGen if no server check is required. The caller can specify `desiredUID` to force a server check if that particular UID isn't a member of the team yet according to local caches; it may be set to "" if no server check is required.
I think this is the only change that is needed.
Line is too long. [101/80]
Please remove the extra line.
I think this should be `bzz`
This is a test that causes a segfault.
I think this should be `update_listener=None` by default.
nit: I think this is a bit confusing. I think it would be better to have a separate check for empty vs non-empty.
I think this is a bit too much. I think we should just check if the active element is a child of the dialog.
import order should be changed
I think this should be `AZKABAN_EVENT_REPORTING_ENABLED`
I think this should be `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`
I think this is not needed.
I think this should be StatusCodeServerErrorRequiredLockIsNotHeldForMDWrite

> FileAccess [](start = 10, length = 11) I think this should be `FileAccess.ReadWrite` by default.
I think this is a bug fix.
I think this should be `public abstract bool Accepts(LogEntry entry, Bloom bloom);`
I think this should be `allowedPostRequest(req, req.getQueryString())`
This is a bit confusing. I think it would be better to have a `Fsync` method on `TLF` that calls `dir.Fsync` and returns the error.
RealPath = new string[] { },
I think you should use the same variable name for both.
I think this should be `api_quota_configs = notifier_configs.get('api_quota', {}).get('quota_config', {})`
I think this should be `Blockly.OUTPUT_VALUE`
I think this is a bug.
I think this is a bit of a hack. I'd rather have a separate reader for the "now" case.
I think this should be `LocalRepo`
I think this is a good name change, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to change the name of the function in the public API. I think it's better to keep the name as it is and add a new function `_apply_to_columns` that does the same thing but applies to columns.
This is the golang entry point for runc init, executed before main() but after libcontainer/nsenter's nsexec().
Unused block argument - deprecation.
I think this should be `padding: 0,`
Line is too long. [82/80]
This is a bug fix, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.
I think this is the right change, but I'm not sure if it's the right place. I think this should be in the `ForceFlushAsync` method.
This is not the same as the original code. The original code was using the width of the character 'a' in the font, which is not the same as the horizontal advance.
This is a bit of a hack. I'm not sure if there's a better way to do this.
I think this is the fix.
I think this is a bug. The mode should be set to `PasscodeMode.Check` only if the user has entered a passcode.
I think this should be `resetCachesWithoutShutdown`
I think this should be `http://localhost:<PORT_DYNAMODB_BACKEND>`
I think this test should be renamed to `TestVerifyTransitionDependenciesResolved`
dilation is not supported in the current version of paddle.vision.ops.v1.py
I think this should be `this.sourceBlock_.setColour(colour, colour, colour);`
I think this is not necessary.
I think this is a bug. The `groupSet` attribute is not supported in the API.
I think this should be `vendor/`
I think this should be `enableScriptEngineLoadExternalResources`
I'm not sure if this is the right thing to do. I think we should still check for the existence of the file.
I think this is a bit confusing. I would rather have a method that takes a `bool` and returns a `str` (or `None` if there is no source).
This is a change in behavior. The previous behavior was to render the inner when the topframes was 1.
I'm not sure if this is a bug or not. I think it's a bug, but I'm not sure.
I think we should use `ShardContext` instead of `ShardItem` here.
I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this. I'm not sure if we should be regenerating the certs for the dynamic listener.
Error running the script.
I think this is a bug. If the system account is not the same as the current account, then the system account should not be set.
I think this is a bug. The `keys` parameter should be a list of strings, not a promise.
This is a bit confusing. I think it would be better to say "expected %d parameters, but got 0 bytes"
HistorySizeLimitError:  dc.GetIntPropertyFilteredByNamespace(dynamicconfig.HistorySizeLimitError, 20*1024*1024), HistorySizeLimitWarn:   dc.GetIntPropertyFilteredByNamespace(dynamicconfig.HistorySizeLimitWarn, 5*1024*1024), HistoryCountLimitError: dc.GetIntPropertyFilteredByNamespace(dynamicconfig.HistoryCount
I think this is a breaking change.
I think this is a bug fix.
if sonata-project/classification exists will set "sonata.classification.manager.category" | if you want to define your own category manager you need to implement \Sonata\MediaBundle\Model\CategoryManagerInterface and set the service name here
I think this should be `easyadmin.config_pass`
@Slow is not needed anymore
I think this should be `window.__mochaResults__`
I think this should be `Markup` instead of `string`
`subdom` is not a valid subdomain.
I think this should be `yarpcerrors.InternalErrorf`
I think this should be `private final PreInvocationAuthorizationReactiveAdvice preInvocationReactiveAdvice;`
I think this is a bug fix.
