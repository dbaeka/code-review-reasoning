The `if err == nil && s.sys != nil && acc != s.sys.account` condition seems to be checking if the system account has been updated, but this check is not necessary if we are sure that `s.sys.account` will never be `nil` (in which case `acc != s.sys.account` will always be `true`). \n\n2. The unlock-lock sequence in this method appears to be incorrect. The lock should be released before the method call and re-acquired after the method call, not the other way around. \n\n3. It's a good practice to handle the case where `err` is `nil` explicitly, rather than letting the `if err != nil` statement catch all non-nil errors.\n\nHere is a refactored version of the code:\n\n```go\nfunc (s *Server) configureAccounts() error {\n    if opts.SystemAccount != _EMPTY_ {\n        s.mu.Unlock()\n        acc, err := s.lookupAccount(opts.SystemAccount)\n        s.mu.Lock()\n        if err != nil {\n            return fmt.Errorf(\"error resolving system account: %"

This may lead to a data inconsistency if another goroutine is executing the same code concurrently, as the update to `s.sys.account` is not atomic. To fix this, consider moving the update of `s.sys.account` inside the lock, ensuring the change is atomic, and executing the non-blocking operation separately to avoid a potential race condition."
