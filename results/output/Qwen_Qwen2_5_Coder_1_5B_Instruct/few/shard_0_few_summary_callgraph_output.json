In this case, `Mz`, `SamplingTime`, and `OneOverK0` are all related to mass spectrometry data, so it's important to use descriptive names that reflect that.\n\nThirdly, it's a good idea to follow the project's coding standards. The code snippet you provided is using the `.####` format for numbers, which is a common practice in scientific numbers. This format ensures that the numbers are readable and easy to understand.\n\nFourthly, it's important to keep the code clean and well-organized. If the constants are used across multiple parts of the codebase, it's important to have a single source of truth for them. Using a common constant name for all of them will make it easier to maintain and update the code in the future."

I don't think ksql supports anything that lets you filter on whether a row itself is null, so with the current implementation we would have to hardcode the decision to either exclude null rows from filters or include them.
